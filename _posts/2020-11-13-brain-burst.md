**R**: [dice] * 30'

You and all conscious creatures in range take [sum] damage and are [stunned](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for 1 turn, or half damage and no stun if a save is successful. If the spell would bring you to 0 Hit Points, all other targets take a additional damage equal to your willpower.
