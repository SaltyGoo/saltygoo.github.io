title: Plasmic Manipulation
---
**R**: 60’ 		**D**: [dice] hours	

You examine the mind of another person for spells or other plasmic entities and may choose one of the following options:

- Steal a spell for later casting. Adding it to your psyche for the duration.
- Implant (and thus lose) a spell into the target’s consciousness.
- Free [dice] number of plasmic entities such as spells from the target’s mind. 

The target of this spell is permitted a saving throw, and if that saving throw is a natural 20 the target may instead raid your mind with recourse to the same three options.
