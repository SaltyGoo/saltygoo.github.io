D: Sigil

You bury teeth around the area you want to curse, needing 1 tooth per square feet you want cursed. Creatures that spend at least 1 full hour inside the area are completely blind to anything blue. Blue things arenâ€™t invisible, but those cursed will never notice them by sight alone. The effect lasts as long as the creatures stay inside, and [dice] days after they leave.

###### *Blue + Blind*
