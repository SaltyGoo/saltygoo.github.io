Sea nymph. A fey.

Imagine a person of extreme beauty, their skin glistening in cresting wave hues, their hair lush with sea foam. Smells like brisk air and has a clear, carrying voice.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** agile and very charismatic <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairie, the nereid *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the nereid is invisible when submerged in water. It can also dive into any wave to teleport to any other wave in sight. It also has a special protective shawl.

<span class="alchemy"> <b>Foam Shawl:</b> Each nereid hides its essence in a 1HD water elemental which it wears as a shawl. Only when the shawl is destroyed does the nereid dies. They only split in dire needs. </span> <br>

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Divination, Enchantment, Thalassomancy.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Weapon</ins>. The nereid makes a weapon attack if it has one.

<ins>Spellcasting (3).</ins> *Create Saltwater, Hypnotic Pattern, Summon Fish, Wall of Foam.*

<ins>Command Sealife.</ins> One marine animal or plant in sight makes a melee attack on a target of the nereid’s choice. It can save to resist.

<ins>Allure of the Sea.</ins> The nereid attempts to bewitch one humanoid or beast in sight. On a fail, the target is charmed until next dawn. The charm breaks if the nereid or its allies attack the charmed person. A creature who succeeds its save is immune to this nereid’s charm forever.

A charmed creature can breath underwater. Whoever hold’s the nereid’s shawl can also make the charmed creature incapable of breathing outside of water. A remove curse spell ends this effect.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>
  
A dying nereid and its shawl both return to water if killed. What is often left is a single, beautiful pearl, and coral jewelry.

Wearing a nereid shawl will give you the inspiration to create a spell with the word *Foam*.
