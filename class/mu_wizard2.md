<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
Inspired by my templateless [Priest](/class/priest) class, I wanted to deconstruct the GLOG wizard into more endible bites for my players. This version does that by focusing on one concept only: spellbooks. It's also designed to easily blend with the exploration aspect of the game by allowing me to add spellbooks to dungeon loots and make them instantly desirable even if the party's wizard already has one. Most of all, it's my homage to what drew me to the GLOG to begin with: the litteral hundreds of wizards classes! Most of the spellbooks described bellow are direct conversions from my favourites among them.

So how is this wizard different from the aforementioned priest? It sure does look identical! Well no. First, the wizard gains SD every level and can do whatever it wants with them, while the priest gains SD each time it matches a certain condition and can only cast each of its spells once per day. Second, the priest chooses a new sacrament every level, a wizard is stuck with its starting spellbook unless it finds new ones in its adventures. The wizard can also spend Treasures to study more spells even when they are not leveling up. In the end, the priest will have fewer spells, but a potentially unlimied amount of spell dices, while the wizard will have 4 spell dices and a potentially unlimited amount of spells. Multiclassing as a Priest and a Wizard is heretical.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A strange hat, ink and quill, a spellbook (see below)

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of "University Graduate", "Alchemist", "Charlatan" or "Heretical Recluse"

For every Wizard template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** (SD) and you **Study**.

## Spells
Wizards get a [random one](/list/spells) for free at level 1. They’re stored in spellbooks and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.
<details markdown="1">
<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary> 
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Wizard template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.
</details>

## Study
You need a Spellbook to study. You cannot take a Wizard template if you do not possess a Spellbook. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again. You can spend a [Treasure](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#treasures) when you end a session in town to study again.
