Means and poisonous forest dragon. A huge beast.

_Imagine a sleek western dragon with a particularly long neck and yellow frills. It loves to lie and manipulate, and it wants as many living humanoids as it can in its hoard._

_Titanic strength, vicious intelligence, overconfident charisma._

<ins>Grasping Roots.</ins> Surfaces near a point the dragon can see erupt with grasping plants that attempt to [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) creatures within them. The area becomes difficult terrain after that.
