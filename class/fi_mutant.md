Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). If your roll gives you an animal, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for it.

Forgotten.

For every Mutant template you have, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

**A:** Font of Flesh, Reactive Mutation<br>
**B:** Regeneration<br>
**C:** Evolution<br>
**D:** Gift of Flesh<br>

## Font of Flesh
Any creature can only have as many scars and mutations as their Constitution score. Scars can be mutated over, but not mutations. If you would gain a mutation above your capacity, you explode, inflicting 1D4 damage per mutation to yourself and all nearby creatures. If you survive, you lose all your mutations and you roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Reactive Mutation
You dont have to wait to the end of the session to gain [new scars](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules#heroism--scars) from your exploits. Instead, once per game, you can immediately react to any brush with death and roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*. Add that mutation to your scar list: you now have advantage against that specific danger as defined by the Referee.

## Regeneration
You can spend your turn gruesomely regenerating. You heal 1D6 wounds and HP. If you do, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Evolution
When you gain a new mutation, you can choose to replace an existing one instead. If you do, you lose 1 point of wisdom until next game.

## Gift of Flesh
You can touch a willing creature and use your regeneration ability on it. Remember they are affected by the Font of Flesh ability.
