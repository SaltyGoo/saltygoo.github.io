title: Alter Gravity
---
R: 60'  D: [sum] rounds

You must cast this spell in an enclosed area with a solid roof of maximu [dice] x 30 feet cube. The target area has its gravity altered to either a direction or a lower strength that you specify for the duration. The effect takes place gradually, allowing creatures a savek to hang on to something. In lower gravity, you can jump higher and farther, but virtually any action requires a Dex check. If you invest 4 or more [dice] the duration becomes permanent.
