<span class="alchemy"> *This was thought as a monster class for the [Cyclopskin](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/cyclopskin). I know that one eyed vision doesn't work like that in real life and that its actually the depth of closer things that would be hard to percieve, but I wanted to create a fighting style that replicated Ulysses famous battle with the cyclops. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>
