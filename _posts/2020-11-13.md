Instantly summon [sum] purses full of gold coins from the Treasury of Hell. They stink of brimstone for a few minutes. You can fling loose coins as you summon them - people-sized and smaller creatures are likely to be startled or knocked off their footing, if they get hit with a flying cloud of a monthâ€™s wages. 

This increases the debt you owe to the Treasury by the amount you summoned and you gain 1 [doom point](/list/spell-catastrophe) for each 4 purses not repaid when you [carouse](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).
