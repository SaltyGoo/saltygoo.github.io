Every time you roll doubles on you Spell Dices, you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you donâ€™t quest to avoid your doom. Choose the following table that makes the most thematic sense:

## You wicked wizard! You attracted the attention of the wrong entity!

1. Your forehead is branded with arcane writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to a greater demon. If this writing is intoned by a any spellcaster, the demon is summoned and the writing disappears.
2. Every time an intelligent life dies from the consequences of one of your spells, the departed soul is fed to a [dretch demon](/monsters/dretch) which is immediately summoned, and confused and ornery from being so disturbed.
3. Anyone that performs a paid service for the you in the future incurs a debt to a devil duke. However, they are not so informed. If they do not discharge the debt, any offspring they have will be replaced with a demon changeling marked with your sigil.
4. The attention of the demon lord Kezgefligrox is attracted, who can now see whatever the sorcerer sees, and speak using the sorcerer's mouth, though the voice becomes different and ominous. The sorcerer's eyes now glow a faint orange in darkness.
