<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Black Spellbook, Ink and Quill, And your choice of a Shovel, a Surgeon Kit, or the Skull of your ancestor.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Mortuary Cult Embalmer, Renegade Archeologist, Local Occultist, or Mad Doctor.

For every Necromancer template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and an **[Necromancy Spell](/spells/#necromancy)**.

**A:** Necromantic Magic, The threshold of Death<br>
**B:** Harvest <br>
**C:** The Three faces <br>
**D:** The three faces <br>

## Necromantic Magic
Necromancers get a second random spell from the [Necromancy school](/spells/#necromancy) at level 1. They can alternatively choose to learn the [Lichcraft](/2020/11/13/lichcraft/) spell instead.  They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Necromancer template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

Because you focus on such dark arts, you begin each adventure chased by the Church.

## The Threshold of Death
You can inflict a [Wound](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to yourself to add 1 SD to a spell you are casting.

You do not fall unconscious nor start dying when you get a [Wound](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). You still die when you get 10 Wounds. However, you only cure as many Wounds as you have Necromancer templates when you rest between adventures.

## Harvest
Everytime you rest in a cemetary or the location of a massacre, you can recruit a new [follower](/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html). This follower is rotting undead and will be hunted down if discovered as such by most humanoids. You can resurect them by inflicting a Wound to yourself.

## The Three Faces
Each morning when the sun rises, you choose whether you are Living, Undead, or Dead, with all that implies.

-  If you are living, you can chose what age you have.
-  If you are undead, you have +1 HP for each Wound you have at sunrise.
-  If you are dead, when you wake up next sunrise, you can halve or double the number of Wounds you have. You of course cannot be killed while dead.

## Undying
You don't die until you get 20 Wounds.
