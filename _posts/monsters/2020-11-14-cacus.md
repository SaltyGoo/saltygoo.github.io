<summary>DM Notes</summary>
In greco-roman mythology, Cacus was a cattle-stealing, fire-breathing giant who fought Hercules. Expending on the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) adaptation of this myth into a DnD monster, I wanted to play on the trope of the handsome ancient greek shepherd who is also an olympian, and make it an asshole jock type of monster. — SaltyGoo
