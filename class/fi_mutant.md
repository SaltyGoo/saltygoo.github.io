Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). If your roll gives you an animal, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for it.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Choose between your Failed Medieval Career, Sewers Life, or Aberrations.

For every Mutant template you have, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

**A:** Font of Flesh, Reactive Mutation<br>
**B:** Evolution<br>
**C:** Gruesome Melding<br>
**D:** Regeneration<br>

_<ins>Design note:</ins> This class is for players who love to be reckless and dont mind dying a lot. As you keep on dying, you will start getting a lot of [scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) in your inventory, making you less and less able to use items. This represents how feral you are getting and is part of the design. If your GLoG rules don't use scars, you might want to include that system just for this class._

## Font of Flesh
You can have as many mutations as your Strength score (they dont take inventory slots). If you would gain a mutation beyond your capacity, you explode, damaging yourself and all nearby creatures for 1d8 damage per 2 mutations you have. You then lose all your mutations and make a new roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Reactive Mutation
When you would be affected by something, you can roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*: You now resist (take half damage or have advantage on your rolls) that type of danger as defined by the Referee as long as you have this mutation. 

## Evolution
When you explode, you can move one of your mutations to your inventory. You dont lose mutations that are in your inventory when you explode.

## Gruesome Melding
You can absorb up to 2 items or 1 follower into your body. If you do, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for each, they are now part of your mutations and become freed once you explode. 

If you meld with a follower, you gain its abilities, one extra head, one extra arm (that can also attack) and one extra personality. You also gain a [trauma](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).

If you meld with an item, you cannot be separated from it. If it is nonmagical, it has unlimited uses/ammunitions and can be repaired at will in 10 minutes. If it is magical, you gain its properties.

## Regeneration
When you explode, your body is born anew and you lose all [scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). Enjoy unlimited explosions! 

Alternatively, when your body is born anew, you can decide to lose all your mutant class levels and abilities and take a level into another class. You keep the mutations selected through the Evolution ability. Enjoy your new life!
