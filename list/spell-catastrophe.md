title: Curses and Catastrophes
---

Catastrophes most often happen when a spellcaster rolls too many pairs and triples on their Spell Dice. But they are also designed to be used as curses by the referee when appropriate. It's a work in progress as I'm doing a list for each of the [Wonder & Wickedness](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145647/Wonder--Wickedness) and [Marvels & Malison](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/211911/Marvels--Malisons) spell schools that I use. Roll smaller dice than a D12 if you want to avoid the character-killing ones. The smaller the roll the kinder the consequence.

## D12 Animorphic Catastrophes
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>1. Last Warning</b></summary>
You are losing your humanity. For the rest of this session and the next one, you cannot use any tools or say sentences longer than 1 word.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>2. Scientific Curiosity</b></summary>
You have become a mutant. Roll on the [mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html). You cannot rest in a town without attracting the attention of vivimancers intent on collecting your organs.
</details>

<summary><b>3. Curse of Bats</b></summary>
Every time you cast a spell, 1D6 screaming bats fly out of your mouth. You are [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for as many turns as you belch them out.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>4. Chimera</b></summary>
You grow an extra [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator) head. It reacts to things as the wild animal would, with fear, hunger or curiosity, independently of you. You have to eat one extra ration per day.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>5. Permanent Transformation</b></summary>
You permanently transform into a [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator). You can still cast spells. If you were already transformed into an animal, this becomes permanent.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>6. Uncivilization</b></summary>
You are now uncomfortable around humans. You must save vs [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when you encounter one you do not know.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>7. Zoophobia</b></summary>
Every animal could be an animorph in disguise! You cannot cast spells in the presence of an animal. You must save vs [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when you witness a creature shapeshifting.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>8. Lycanthropy</b></summary>
The next time the sun sets, you will transform into a [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator) and try to bite as many people as possible before sunrise. Each bitten person will be affected by the same curse and transform into the same animal the next sunset. This has a 1/6 chance to happen every subsequent sunset. When you spend a night like this, you become [fatigued](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and do not recuperate your spell dice. Hunters are on their way to kill you.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>9. Unwelcomed Adaptation</b></summary>
Your nostrils are replaced by gills. You can breathe underwater but not outside of it.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>10. Wrong Layout</b></summary>
How is a body made again? Roll a D6: 1, left leg; 2, right leg; 3, left arm; 4, right arm; 5, chest; 6, head. Then roll again. The first limb is replaced by a new second limb. Reroll if they are the same.
</details>

<summary><b>11. Oozification</b></summary>
You simply do not hold shape anymore. You have become an ooze. You have 3 inventory slots and can't talk.

<summary><b>12. Abduction</b></summary>
The next time you go outside, a sickly light will pierce the sky and shine on you. You, and only you, will see the silhouettes of strange humanoids reaching out for you. The rest of the world will see you disappear. You will be found naked in a completely different location 1D4 years later with no memories.
</details>

## D12 Diabolic Catastrophes
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>1. Last Warning</b></summary>
Your forehead is branded with heretical writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to be judged. Any agent of the Church or the Law will be compelled to prosecute you if they see it. Additionaly, if this writing is intoned by _any_ spellcaster or cleric, a [greater divine agent](/list/monsters-celestial) will be summoned.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>2. Devilish Pride</b></summary>
You and all allies nearby grow long, curving, goatlike horns. These are permanent, and mark those so affected as traffickers in diabolic magic. Inquisitors are on their way.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>3. Abyssal Poachers</b></summary>
You have been marked as a disturber of souls. Every time an intelligent life dies because of you, 1D4 of the [dretch demons](/monsters/dretch) tracking you are summoned to feast on it. This does not please the Authority.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>4. Intermediary Contractor</b></summary>
Anyone that makes a deal with you is unknowingly also making a deal with the devil who inherited you soul. If they do not discharge the debt, their souls are also inherited by it. Because of that, the devil will do everything short of direct intervention to prevent them from fulfilling their debt to you.

</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>6. Nightmare Manifested</b></summary>
One randomly determined person near the casting of the spell in your group is permanently marked with a demonic sigil. This sigil conjures a [lesser horror](/list/monsters-aberration) each time the afflicted person sleeps. Determine its reaction as normal.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>7. The Teint</b></summary>
You are permanently imbued with the nature of demons, and becomes subject to many demonic weaknesses. For example, holy water becomes damaging, circles of protection keep you out, and so forth. Furthermore, you lose the ability to cross running water without collapsing into unconsciousness. Crossing a line of salt, such as used with some magic circles, causes you 1D6 damage.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>8. An Eye for an Eye</b></summary>
An imp familiar is summoned. This familiar has your eyes, which cease to reside in your head. You continue to be able to see from the eyes, though do not control the imp directly. The imp may not travel more than 100 feet away from you. If it is slain, the eyes are banished to another place where swirling colors and running, pulsing veins are all that is visible.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>9. Revelation</b></summary>
The skies of far off places open above you. The vista seen contains geometries beyond the abilities of mortals to understand. All witnessing this display stand in awe and must make a saving throw.
