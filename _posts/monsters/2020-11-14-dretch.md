Stinky trash demon. A small aberration.

_Imagine a slumbering and bloated hairless green monkey with a bat face. All it wants is to create the biggest pile of rotting flesh._

_Like a very dumb and evil chimp._

The most common and least powerful of all demons according to Jim Holloway in the [Monster Manual II](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17005/Monster-Manual-II-1e). I wanted to keep them pretty close to the original. â€” SaltyGoo
