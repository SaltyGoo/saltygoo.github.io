D: Sigil

You awaken the disembodied head of [dice] of your enemies killed in combat by tracing your Sigil on them while whispering it its ears awful menaces. The heads will be watchful and report what they see and hear when interrogated by you, but have scarce recollections of their previous life. They will still recognize people, and shout out an alarm if your enemies appear.
