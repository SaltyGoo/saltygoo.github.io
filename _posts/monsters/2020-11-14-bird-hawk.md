title: Bird, Hawk
---

**Fast predatory sky-diving bird.** Hawks will not attack prays bigger than them unless trained to do so or defending their nest. They are only active during the day. Carnivorous.

_Imagine a small bird with aerodynamic wings, piercing yellow eyes and feathers that alternate between brown, gray and white. The hawk is a diurnal predator._

**Attacks (2/round)**

<ins>Swift Fly-By</ins>. The hawk makes a melee attack (1 dmg) and flies away. Attacks against it on its turn have disadvantage.

<ins>Gouging Talons</ins>. The hawk makes a melee attack (1 dmg) against one target. If it is the second time it hits it this turn, the target is [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for its next turn.

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of silver in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of silver spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence. 

The same process is used to tame a giant hawk, but it costs 1 bag of _gold_ coins instead.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Hawk’s meat has a dry, leathery texture, but is still edible. Its feathers are prized by bowyers.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
