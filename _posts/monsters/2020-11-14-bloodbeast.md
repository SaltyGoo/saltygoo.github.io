Giant spider leech. A beast.

Imagine a sand colored leech as long as a horse. It stands high on six long insectoid legs. Its head is framed by vestigal gills.

Always hungry, it is an ambush predator.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** sturdy and feral<br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Bloodbeasts camouflage very well in rocky landscapes. They can jump 30’ without momentum. They dont see much, but sensors on their skin allow them to operate without sight.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite.</ins> The bloodbeast makes a melee attack with reach (2D4) and grapples the target. As long as a target is grappled, it cannot use its bite attack.

<ins>Drain Blood.</ins> The bloodbeast inflicts constitution damage (1D4) to a grappled target as it drains its blood.

# Bloodgill

Bloodsucking bipedal tadpoles.

**Size:** tiny <br>

# Bloodgill Swarm

**HD:** 0 +3D4HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:**  feral<br>
**Movement:** slow, swim average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Bloodgills are amphibious and can breath as well in water as outside. They can jump 10’ without momentum. They dont see much, but sensors on their skin allow them to operate without sight.

In a swarm, bloodgills are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bites.</ins> The Bat Swarm makes a melee attack with reach using its HP as its attack stat. On a hit, the target has 1D4 bloodgills (see above) attached to it and the swarm loses as many hit points.

The bloodbeast and the bloodgill are orginal creations of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/11/new-oebx1e-monster-bloodgill_20.html) originaly for his* Starmaster* sci-fi game. It's weird and I love the idea of being sucked dry by a swarm of bipedal tadpoles. — SaltyGoo
