You drain the liquids out of one target within range, inflicting 1D6 + [dice] damage, doubled if it's a liquid or gelatinous creature. Can also be used to turn [sum] square feet of meat into jerky or concentrate one bottle of liquid (wine, most acids) into [dice] more potent concentrated doses. You can make a cup full of very strong brandy from a bottle of wine for example. Alternatively, you can also destroy [dice] x 5' cube of water.
