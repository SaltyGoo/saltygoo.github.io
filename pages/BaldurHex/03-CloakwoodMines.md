<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for information on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

*Unless you arrive from [02 - Wyvern Fork](/pages/BaldurHex/02-WyvernFork), features B and C of this hex are inaccessible. The party must find a way to cross River Raeth first.*

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Raeth Gorges </span>

The mist-cloaked gorge of river Raeth is 50 ft wide and 100 ft deep. Sometimes, mysterious barges sail upstream under the cover of Davaeorn's illusory magic.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Iron Throne Camp </span>

This nature-besieged lumber camp is a cover for the Iron Throne's mining activities. The tension is high between the druids, the Iron Throne, and bounty hunters.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Iron Throne Fort </span>

This small motte-and-baily fort hidden in the forest is built atop the old flooded mines of dwarven clan Orothiar. The archmage Davaeorn has been dispatched by the Iron Throne to drain them.
