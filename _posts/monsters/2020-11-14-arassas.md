*Acid-spitting snow lizard-cat. *

###### Beast. Adapted from [the Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium)

A gigantic white furred lizard with black lips and a blue tongue. The arassas is a nocturnal ambush predator, using its breath to slowly kill travelers.

**HD:** 6  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** huge &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 7 / 8 / 2 / 5 / 6 <br>
**Armor:** leather <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average, climb average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The arassas is stealthy for its size, and is very hard to hear and see in an snowy landscape. Its clawed, woolly paws allow it to ignore icy terrain. It also has a keen smell that helps it detect its preys.

**Attacks:** Each round, the arassas can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Trash</ins>. The arassas makes a melee attack (x) against all creatures adjacent to it. Hit targets must succeed a strength save or be knocked prone.

<ins>Rake</ins>. The arassas makes two melee attacks (x) against one target.

<ins>Pounce</ins>. The arassas makes a running jump and lands on a target, which is allowed a dexterity save to avoid damage. On a hit, the target takes damage (2x), is prone and grappled.

<ins>Acid Hiss</ins> (recharge 2/6). The arassas spreads a short cone with acidic spit, inflicting acid damage (2x) to all objects and creatures. A saving throw halves the damage. 

The area and targets are covered in the liquid, which is anti-icing. Until they are washed, creatures become vulnerable to the effect of hypothermia, and any previously frozen area becomes very slippery.

## Salvaging the Body

Arassas meat tastes horrible, but is not poisonous. Its fur is very warm and its teeth can be used as weapons. More importantly, it’s bile is a prized anti-icing.
