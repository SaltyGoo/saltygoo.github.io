## Many Goblins
Goblins can see and smell in the dark as if they were holding torches.

Your HP represents how many goblins are alive. Every point of damage causes a single goblin to die in an inconsequential background sort of way. If you are reduced to 0 HP, the goblins become strewn about the place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help anyone until healed.

Because goblins eat trash, you only eat as much rations as one humanoid. When performing basic unskilled labor, like digging a trench or carrying buckets, you count as as many people as your HP, but you give up after 1 hour. You can occupy a space as big as 10 square feet.

## Goblin Boss
One goblin in the swarm has earned a name. Give it a name and a short description. Once per encounter, the named goblin can do something different than the Many Goblins, giving you an extra turn. Each Goblin boss comes equiped with a different [random object](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) each battle.

## Loose Gang
When not in battle, you cannot lose more than 1 HP at a time. In battle, you count as adjacent to all allies and enemies at all time.
