title: Shadow, Elven
---

Husk of a corrupted elf. An undead.

Imagine a dark silhouette against a wall. When it crosses light, you can clearly see the outline of a naked elf, except its fingers are thrice as long and its mouth seems to cut its face in half.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** agile, maddly emotional <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As an undead creature, the shadow does not starve to death, breathe, sleep or tire and cant be poisoned. As an ethereal creature, it is immune to damage from a nonmagical source, as well as grapples and petrification. However, direct sunlight makes it lose all resistances and immunities. Silver weapons similarly ignore their resistances. For shadows, the same is true of damage sources that emits light.

Additionally, the elven shadow can see in the dark, sneak very efficiently and smell magic. If it is hit by a spell, the shadow gains an additional attack per round for the rest of the battle. If it manages to kill a magic-user, the elven shadow will recover its original, beautiful elven form just long enough to cast one spell (roll randomly) before being vaporized again into shadow form.

**Attacks (1/round)***

<ins>Shadowy Claws</ins>. The shadow makes a melee attack (1D6). If the target is a magic user, it loses one SD.

<summary>D6 What the Monster Wants</summary>

1. To cast magic. Desperately
1. To inflict pain, as a relief for their own.
1. To be elven, beautiful and horny again.
1. For somebody to clean their vaporized silhouette. But not a magic user, they'll want to devour that instead.
1. For somebody to enact the last steps of the depraved ritual they were so close to accomplish.
1. To please a demon of lust.

<summary>Summoning the Spirit</summary>

If you know the spell [Occult Consultation](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/13/occult-consultation/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 2 Spell Dices:

**Summon Elven Shadow** <br>
R: 50’

A demon of lust must owe you a favor to cast this spell, as elven shadows are by definition owned by them. The duration of the summon is permament and the shadow will attempt to hunt and kill all magic users it can, you included. If you know the location of its vaporized silhouette, you can bargain with the shadow: its freedom for the knowledge of a new spell.

This version of the shadow are a creation of [Jacob Hurst, Evan Peterson, and Donnie Garcia](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/) found in [Hot Springs Island](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/the-dark-of-hot-springs-island/). The creatures are not statted in the book, so I made my own version. — SaltyGoo
