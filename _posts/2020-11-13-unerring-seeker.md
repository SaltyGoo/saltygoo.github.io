You could find a grain of sand in a dune. You name an object you are looking for. If it is in range, thunder dramatically strikes, and you know exactly where it is. Everybody interested in the object and at least one devil become aware you have successfully cast this spell 

The range of the spell depends on the number of [dice] invested: 
1. 60' 
2. 1 hex 
3. all adjacent hexes 
4. whole plane
