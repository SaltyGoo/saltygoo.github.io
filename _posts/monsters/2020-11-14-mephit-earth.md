- You gain 1 [Spell Die](/spells/) and learn the spell _Conjure Gravel Mephit_ (below);
- Roll a D6, you <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Permanent mutations take an inventory slot">mutate</span> in the following way :

1. 1D4 inventory slots are filled with gravel. It comes back as soon as you remove it.
1. Your words are replaced by tiny gravel mephits that mime them before collapsing.
1. Your sweat is replaced by sand. You'll never be comfortable again.
1. Each time you rest, one thing near you is stolen by a mephit and brought to the plane of earth.
1. You have a phobia of not touching the ground.
1. You can change one word from a class ability you have or a spell you know to *gravel*.

R: self 

When casting the spell you must prepare a statement with up to [sum] words. [sum] gravel mephits are then summoned and redirected to an object of your choice across any plane. The mephits will try to bury the object and engrave the message on the cairn. The mephits can bury the volume equivalent of [dice] humans.
