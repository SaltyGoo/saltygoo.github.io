<button id="generateText" >Generate Encounter</button> <br>

<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for information on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Mutamin's Garden</span>

Giant fossilized bones of long-forgotten creatures pierce the rocky landscape like claws, and the many marble statues of adventures frozen in terror only add to the eery mood of this place. Here dwell Mutamin's many pet basilisks.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Bonegnawers' Den</span>

This bone-littered burrow is home to Korax and his family, a small community of relatively non-threatening ghouls. They are immune to the basilisks' gazes, but fear the mad wizard Mutamin.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Mutamin's Hut</span>

The mad gnome Mutamin has been studying basilisks here for decades. He has rejected society, living in squalor in his hut. He does not trust humanoids.
