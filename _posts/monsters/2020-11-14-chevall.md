Horsewere that can turn into a centaur. A fey.

Imagine the upper body of a human joined to the body of a horse. A centaur then, except it has horse ears and eyes. It strangely looks like a horse you've seen before.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy and perceptive <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairy, the chevall *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, chevalls have exceptional endurance and very keen eyes. They can speak the tongue of horses and have advantage on all their social rolls towards equine creatures. They are not slowed down when grappling creatures.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Trample.</ins> If it has the space for it, the chevall charges, attacking every smaller creature in its path (1D6), inflicting double damage to prone creatures.

<ins>Hooves.</ins> The chevall attacks a target with its hooves (1D6). If the chevall is in centaur form, it can make a grapple attempt.

<ins>Summon Horses (1/day).</ins> The chevall summons 1D6 horses which will obey it.

<ins>Command Horse.</ins> The chevall gives a two-word order to a horse it can see and the horse must obey it. It must be an order that can be followed in one action.

<ins>Shapechange.</ins> The chevall takes the shape of a horse or a centaur.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

A bow made of chevall mane shoots exceptionally well and makes even better music.

Chevall leather is very supple, and makes excellent saddles. Except that no equine creatures will want to be ridden with one.

By learning how to whisper to mares like a chevall, a wizard can create a new spell with the word *horse*.

<span class="alchemy">**Chevall Musk.** Is very pleasant to equine creatures.</span>

<summary>Credits</summary>
Originating from [Mystara](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/chevall.html), the chevall must be one of the weirdest official DnD monster, which makes me want to find ways to use it. First of all, its name is just horse in French with an extra L. Secondly, it's a horse that can transform into a centaur, not the other way around!
