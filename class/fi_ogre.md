<span class="alchemy"> *This was initially a monster class for the [ogre](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/ogre), but it could be reflavored as any big bully. — SaltyGoo* </span>

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Club, 1 ration.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Smashing.

For every Ogre template you have, you get more fat (it takes one inventory slot), you grow 1’ .

**A:** Bulk, Ogremouth<br>
**B:** Smash<br>
**C:** Bully<br>
**D:** Food = Strength<br>

## Bulk
For each inventory slot you have taken by fat, increase your maximum HP by 1. When in town between adventures, each Treasure spent carousing can give you more fat if you want.

## Ogremouth
You can eat any object bigger than a chicken and softer than metal as a ration. If you dont eat the equivalent of two rations per day, you lose 1 layer of fat.

## Smash
You can replace your melee damage rolls with the number of inventory slots you have taken by fat.

## Bully
Once per encounter, you can give a one-word command to a creature that is smaller than you. The creature can choose to fall prone instead of obeying the order.

## Fat = Strong
Each ration you eat after the two you need each day give you 1D4 extra temporary HP. You will have to eat as much tomorrow, but with no benefit.
