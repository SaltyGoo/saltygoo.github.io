**R**: 60â€™        **D**: [dice]*10 minutes

_All iterations of [animal] should be replaced by a specific animal species when the spell is first found._

You may charm up to [dice] HD of [animal], the victims enthralled with no save. You also gain the ability to engage in limited communication and, whilst the animals cannot be commanded, they will be positively disposed to assist you.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent and they become followers.
