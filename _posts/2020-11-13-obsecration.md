**R**: 1 hex 		**D**: 10 minutes

A nearby [dice] HD creature (which must have consciousness and must be living) is called to aid you. It will serve you loyally for 10 minutes after arrival. 

The creature must physically travel to you (taking 2D6 rounds to do so), retains memory of all acts committed while under the influence of the spell, and will feel oddly satisfied about serving you afterwards (assuming that the creature’s basic ethos was not violated).
