**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

Your soul is placed in a talisman like a pendant or an article of clothing marked by your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), leaving the original body behind in stasis. 

While in the talisman, your consciousness remains active and aware of events nearby, and may possess any [dice] HD body that comes in contact with the talisman, though a save is permitted if the possession is resisted. 

If this new body is slain while occupied by your soul, a saving throw is required for your soul to return to the talisman and avoid becoming trapped in the spirit world.
