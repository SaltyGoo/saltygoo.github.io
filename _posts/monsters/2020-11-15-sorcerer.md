<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some [humanoids](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-humanoid) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Underlined abilities are added to the attack options of the original creature. For damage, replace X with the creature's basic attack damage. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Sorcerers are innate spellcasters who can unleash powerful spells upon which they have little control. They are often magical creatures themselves that honed their powers beyond normal, or mortals bound to a specific element.

<summary>Features</summary>
As fickle and fascinating as flames. Its eyes are lit with a joyful yet menacing flicker.

**Stats:** Unchanged.

The fire trickster resists fire. It can enter flames as if they were a door and come out of another flame it can see.

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Pyromancy

<ins>Scalding Ember.</ins> The sorcerer makes a ranged attack (X). One flammable object on the target catches on fire. If the attack misses, the ground nearby is ablaze for 2 turns.
