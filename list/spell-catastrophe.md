_Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 Doom Point. Every time you gain a Doom Point, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. Reroll results you already got._
 
### Your Powers Have Become Blasphemous! Catastrophe! Roll a D10.
1. **Last Warning.** Your forehead is branded with heretical writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to be judged. If this writing is intoned by _any_ spellcaster or cleric, a [greater divine agent](/list/monsters-celestial) will be summoned.
2. **Abyssal Pantry.** Every time an intelligent life dies because of your magic, their departed soul is fed to a [dretch demon](/monsters/dretch) which is immediately summoned, and is confused and ornery from being so disturbed.
3. **Infernal Representative.** Anyone that makes a deal with you in the future is actually making a deal with the devil duke who now owns your soul. However, they are not so informed. If they do not discharge the debt, any offspring they have will be replaced with a demon changeling marked with your sigil. Because of that, the devil will indirectly impede them in their action.
4. **Demonic Vessel**. The attention of a Demon Lord is attracted. It can now see whatever you see, and speak using your mouth, though the voice becomes different and ominous. Your eyes now glow a faint orange in darkness. Chaos will be sowed by it/you.
5. **Real Nightmares.** One randomly determined person near the casting of the spell is permanently marked with a demonic sigil. This sigil conjures a [lesser horror](/list/monsters-aberration) each time the afflicted person sleeps. Determine its reaction as normal.
6. **Out and Wicked**. You and all allies nearby grow long, curving, goatlike horns. These are permanent, and mark those so affected as traffickers in diabolic magic. Inquisitors are on their way
7. **Tainted Forever.** You are permanently imbued with the nature of demons, and becomes subject to many demonic weaknesses. For example, holy water becomes damaging, circles of protection keep you out, and so forth. Furthermore, you lose the ability to cross running water without collapsing into unconsciousness. Crossing a line of salt, such as used with some magic circles, causes you 1D6 damage.
8.
