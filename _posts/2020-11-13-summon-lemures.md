**R**: 30' **D**: 1 hour

[Lemures](/monsters/lemure) are basically the trash of Hell. Devils don't mind sending [sum] of them to you. In fact you're doing them a favor by giving them a place to dump all of their garbage.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent and [sum] lemures spawn every 10 minutes instead.

**DM Note:** _it might be easier to count the lemures as one swarm of [sum] HP._
