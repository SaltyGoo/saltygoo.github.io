D: Sigil

You place a portal Sigil on two doors and, by the casting of this spell, connect them so that they become the same door as long as the Sigils endure. 

A traveller stepping into one steps out of the other, with directionality of travel governed by the facing of the Sigil (travellers enter toward the Sigil and exit from it). 

This spell only works on doors of established essence, and a portal can be used [dice] times before breaking, but, if you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect is permanent.

If one of the door is damaged enough, there is [dice] in 6 chances that somebody using the portal will get lost.
