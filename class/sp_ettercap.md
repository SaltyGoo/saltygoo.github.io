###### A monster class for the [Ettercap](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/ettercap), spider-people. But could also be used for a litteral spider. Illustratio by [Kaluta](http://www.kaluta.com/).

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A wrapped dessicated Body, a glowing Stone.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Ropes, and either Fairy Hunting, Canopy Life, or Sewing.

For every Spiderfolk template you have, you can produce an extra 30 ft of rope per day.

**A:** Spider Climb, Spider Sense<br>
**B:** Patience<br>
**C:** Amazing Spider Person<br>
**D:** Ettercap Venom<br>

## Spider Climb
You always count as having climbing gear. If a climb would be trivial using gear, you don’t need to roll, even if you’re free-climbing. If a climb would be impossible using gear, you can roll anyway.

## Spider Sense
You can sense and describe the shape of everything a rope you touch touches.

## Patience
You can stay perfectly still for as long as you want. Once hidden, you will not be found unless somebody looks for you.

## Amazing Spider Person
You can shoot your rope like a grappling hook and it will stick to whatever surface is there. You can do this as an attack too.

## Ettercap Venom
You start each day with 3 doses of Ettercap Venom. They expire at the end of the day.

<span class="alchemy">**Ettercap Venom.** Save or be poisoned, save again each day to cure. Poisoned fairies lose all their powers.  </span>
