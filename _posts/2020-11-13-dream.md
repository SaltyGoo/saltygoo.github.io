This spell can be cast at any creature you have a token of (a used piece of clothes, a favourite item, a drop of blood, a lock of hair), or whom you have marked with your sigil. You fall into a trance that lasts until you break concentration. 

Once your target falls asleep, you enter their dream for [sum] minutes. You can converse freely and exchange information in the dream, but upon waking up, the target must Save or forget the whole conversation. You will remember automatically.

You can also attack the target in the dream, causing them a terrible nightmare. The first of you or your target who is reduced to 0 hp during the dream fight wakes up abruptly, gaining no benefit from the rest and sleep.
