Sentient earth. An earth elemental.

Imagine earth moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in tremors and groans.

**HD:** X  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** any <br>
**Stats:** strong & sturdy, dumb & clumsy <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As elemental earth, the earth elemental *resists all damage*. It *recovers X HP* every round spent on the ground and *takes 1D4 damage* each round spent not touching it. In general, it has the same properties as earth.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Slam</ins>. The elemental makes a melee attack (XD4 damage). It inflicts double damage to structures.

<ins>Sink</ins>. Until the end of its next turn, the elemental or an adjacent creature treat earth as water.

<ins>Create Rock</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates a 5' cube of boulder which it can throw as a ranged attack (XD4 damage).
