D: Sigil

You prostrate yourself in front of your new master as you give them control over [dice] of your spell dices.

Your master can spend these dices on spells as normal, or trade one back to give you a command you cant refuse, which can be to die. You cannot remove this Sigil without your masterâ€™s permission.
