**R**: 30’ **D**: [dice] hours

By standing completely still with eyes closed in concentration, you may psychically enter the body of another, gaining access to any of their senses, and dictate the subject’s physical actions. For the duration of the spell, you can attempt to take over the mind of one creature in range if they fail a saving throw. You can keep trying on different targets or the same one on each of your subsequent turns as long as you stay immobile, but targets who resist become aware of your attempts.

When dominated, subjects of this spell may choose to resist any given dictated action by taking [dice] damage instead, but nothing prevents you of repeating the command every round.
