title: Sigil of Bezaliel
---

You summon Bezaliel the Virtue. A tall human figure, a silhouette of total darkness. He wears a pair of spectacles, one lens red, the other green. He has broad black wings, lightless and dotted with tiny stars. His halo, too, is darkness. He carries a book full of indecipherable symbols. He communicates in single words and expansive gestures. Timid and gentle. 

Bezaliel will place a black door with an indecipherable symbol on it anywhere within [dice] hexes of the place you have summoned him. The next [dice] times that door is opened, it leads to the place you summoned Bezaliel. After that, the door vanishes harmlessly. 

Bezaliel will make you invisible in darkness for [dice] hours. 

Bezaliel will make you immune to scrying of all kinds for [dice] hours. 

Bezaliel will give you [dice] doom points if you are famous in any way.
