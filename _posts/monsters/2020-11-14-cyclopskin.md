*One-eyed humanoids that look like bigger, lankier orcs. Humanoid*

<span class="alchemy"> *The cyclops has the problem of many giants in DnD in the fact that they have no abilities besides being big. It's a bit sad, especially for something as visualy striking as the cyclops. What I did was to give its eye a power and a reason to exploit this weakness. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a humanoid with one stupid eye. Cyclopskins are more often than not orcs with cyclops blood.
