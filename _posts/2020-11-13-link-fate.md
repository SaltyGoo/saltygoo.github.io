**R**: 30' **D**: [dice] * 10 minutes

Using this ability requires a psychic link to be established. You and target creature are linked mentally by fate, meaning that whenever one loses hit points so does the other, though they can save to halve this damage. When one creature dies, the other must save or drop to 0 HP. The two creatures are always vaguely aware of the other and know their general direction.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and inscribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on your target, the effect becomes permanent.
