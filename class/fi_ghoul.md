Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) but make it worn and tattered.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your failed career. Stealth and Climbing.

For every Ghoul template you have, your climbing skill increases by 1.

**A:** The Hunger, Numbing Saliva<br>
**B:** Rotten Teeth<br>
**C:** Tail<br>
**D:** Lizard Brute
<br>

## The Hunger
You are infected by ghoul rabies and cannot be cured. Yet you cannot die from hunger or other diseases. 

<span class="alchemy">
**Ghoul Rabies**. Disease. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: requires to eat 1 extra ration per day. You can only eat flesh from intelligent beings.
</span>

Instead, for each day you cannot sustain yourself completely, you move down one step the symptom scale. As soon as you eat enough, you move up one step.

**Catatonic** > **Sluggish** > **Feral** > **Rational** > **Refined**
