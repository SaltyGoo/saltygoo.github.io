*One-eyed giant with bad luck. Humanoid*

<span class="alchemy"> *The cyclops has the problem of many giants in DnD in the fact that they have no abilities besides being big. It's a bit sad, especially for something as visualy striking as the cyclops. What I did was to give its eye a power and a reason to exploit this weakness. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a gigantic humanoid with only one stupid eye. Its wearing nothing but a loincloth.

**HD:** 7+7  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** huge &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 5 / 10 / 4 / 3 / 5  <br>
**Armor:** as leather <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

**Evil Eye:** If a creature casts or concentrate on a spell the two of them can see each other, the cyclops can force the creature to make a saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails.

**Poor Death Perception:** The cyclops has disadvantage on any attack and skill rolls relating to things that are not nearby.

**Attacks:** Each round, the cyclops can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Club.</ins> The cyclops makes one melee attack (x).

<ins>Rock.</ins> The cyclops makes one ranged attack (x).

<ins>Blind Flailing.</ins> The cyclops moves its full movement towards a noise. Each creature and objects in its path take damage (x) if they fail a dex save, including the cyclops.
