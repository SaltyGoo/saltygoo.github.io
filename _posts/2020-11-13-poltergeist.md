**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

A poltergeist is summoned to haunt a place or possession, which must be marked with a [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon). While alone, the phantos will do its best to harass and torment the [dice] next creatures that enter the building. 

Though the poltergeist cannot talk and are insubstantial, you can direct it to laugh insanely, become visible as ghostly menaces, howl discordantly, and cause telekinetic mischief, which may include the hurling of heavy or sharp objects, though the referee should decide exactly what the poltergeists do.
