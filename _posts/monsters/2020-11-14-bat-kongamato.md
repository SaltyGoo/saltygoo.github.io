title: Bat, Kongamato
---

Amphibious, diseased death bats. A beast.

Dark red and with thick leathery wings, the kongamato smells of swamp water. Its amphibious nature explains its name, which means “boat toppler” in the local tongue.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** medium <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** agile and dumb<br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast, swim average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark: as long as they can hear, they can detect invisible creatures. 

**Attacks (2/round)**

<ins>Bite</ins>. The kongamato makes a melee attack with disadvantage (2D4). 

<ins>Claws</ins>.  The kongamato makes a melee attack (1D4). On a hit, the target must save against disease or catch eye rot.

<span class="alchemy"> **Eye Rot**: Disease. You have a maximum vision of 50'. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: -10’ max vision. </span>

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Kongamato fur is waterproof. You would still need the skin of two to make an outfit. Its guano or flesh can be used as a carrier of Eye Rot disease.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The kongamato is a cryptid from Zambia described as a giant pterodactyl whose name means "boat-turner". [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) chooses to make it a bat and a carrier of diseases. I like that. DnD needs much more diseases. — SaltyGoo
