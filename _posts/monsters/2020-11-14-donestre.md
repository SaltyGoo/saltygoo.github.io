Self-hating friend-eating lion-person. A fey.

_Have you ever felt so miserable and unloved you could cry? This lanky, sad, wet lion-person embodies that. It could be majestic but looks miserable. It looks at you with sad saucer eyes._

_Protective of the dead, mean spirited, elusive._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 3 | **Armor:** none |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast     |   | 

It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** hear, smell and lie very well, see in the dark and be understood by any creature.
**Also**, as a imaginary creature, willpower must be used for attack rolls against it instead of dexterity. 

Any creature hearing and understanding the donestre speak for 1 minute must save with disadvantage or be charmed for 1 hour. If both rolls are failures, the target is dominated instead. A creature succeeding its save is immune to this donestre’s words for 24h. This ability fails on targets battling the donestre.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Love Me!</ins> The donestre makes a [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) attempt, followed by a bite melee attack (1D6).

<ins>Kill Me!</ins> The donestre makes a desperate melee attack with a weapon or its claws (1D8). Until its next turn, its target has advantage on its attacks against the donestre.

<ins>Pity Me!</ins> Decapitated heads within sight start wailing. As many other targets and the donestre must save or be [frightened](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

You ...(Roll as many times as the HD of the monster)

1. Nothing.
1. A lock of hair from an innocent.
1. Jewelry from a foreign land (valuable).

Conversing with heads collected by a donestre might give a wizard the inspiration to create a spell with the word friendship.

Illustration by [Thomas Hanusek](https://krassekunst.de/). The donestre is a weird monster from the east described in the middle ages. It preys on travelers by speaking their language. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) is what inspired me. I gave them my typical fey resistances, and evocative attacks to highlight their tortured nature. — SaltyGoo
