title: Gremlin, Gremishka
---

Kleptomaniac house fairy. A fey.

Imagine a pint-sized, furred, cat-eyed humanoid with a muzzle. It moves around at high speed, often passing for a house cat or a rat, but its long fingered hands and feet and oversized toothy mouth betrays its supernatural nature.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** weak, yet agile <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairy, the Gremishka *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the gremishka can see in the dark and is very stealthy.

Gremishkas are notably allergic to magic. If a spell is cast within 30' of one of them, roll a D3 on this table once:

1. The caster nearly mishaps. It gains [1 Doom Point](/class/wizard#spells).
2. The gremishkas in range grow! They gain 1D4 extra HP.
3. The gremishkas multiply! Add a new swarm of them to the encounter.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite and Scratches</ins>. The gremishka makes a melee attack (1 damage). It then sneaks away nearby.

<ins>Steal</ins>. A target in melee range must save or have a small object from their inventory stolen. The gremishka then sneaks away nearby.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

There is not much to do with the tiny naked body of a gremshika. Maybe an ugly fur coat could be made with the skin of 30 of them?

A wizard who manages to live in a house infected by gremishkas and ignore them for 7 days straight has the mad inspiration to write a spell with the word _kettle_ in it.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The original gremishka comes from [Ravenloft](https://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/gremishk.html), and like many Ravenloft creatures, it is full of creepy flavor. For once, the [5e version](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/993-gremishka-terrify-spellcasters-with-these-tiny) made them even more interesting, adding OSR-style chaos to them.
