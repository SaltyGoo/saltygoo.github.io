*Snake-bearded devil soldier.*

###### Divine Creature. Adapted from [the Monster Manual (5e)](https://5e.tools/book.html#mm)

Imagine a humanoid with blue or red skin, goat legs and horns, a lizard tail, and, even more disturbingly, a beard made of hissing snakes. It holds a barbed glaive.

Barbazus (also known as bearded devils) conscript wayward souls into the war against aberrations. When seen on the material plane, they are often in a punitive expedition.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / (5) / 7 / 4 / 5 / 5   <br>
**Immunities:** curses, fear <br>
**Resistances:** all <br>
**Armor:** chain <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** reckless <br>

**Spellcasting:** *Thaumaturgy, Control Flames, Cause Fear*

The blue abishai is a very powerful magic user and can be considered to know other spells for most occasions.

The barbazu can see in the dark and speak telepathically. Its weapon is made of [platinum](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules#rare-metals). 

**Attacks:** Each round, the barbazu can cast a spell or perform one of these actions:

<ins>Barbed Glaive.</ins> The barbazu makes a melee attack (x) with reach. A living creature must then save or take (x) nonlethal damage at the beginning of its turn. The effect can be ended with a successful medicine check or any other healing.

<ins>Snake Beard.</ins>  The barbazu makes a melee attack (x) with its beard. On a hit, the target must make a save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, it cannot heal. The target can attempt a save again at the end of each of its turns.

<ins>Summon Lemures</ins> (recharge 2/6). The barbazu summons 1D4 lemures which appear in 1D4 turns.
