title: Engine of Pain
---

Mech-suits with construction tools. A construct with an unconscious humanoid inside.

_A steaming, rusty mech-suit. Trapped inside are the vegetative remains of a punished humanoid. All it understands now are the orders of its master, and pain._

_Numbed by pain, focused on the task, stilted movements._

| **HD:** 3 | **Armor:** as plate  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |

It is **immune** to [fatigue](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [poison](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and diseases (because it's an object). 

Targeting the body inside the engine is made at disadvantage but inflicts 1D8 extra damage.

**Attacks (1/round)**
Each engine of pain is outfitted with a tool on each of its arms, roll 1D4 twice: 1, claw; 2, hammer; 3, drill; 4, sonic blaster.

<ins>Claw.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (1D6) and grapples on a hit.

<ins>Hammer.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (1D6) and a target with less than 5 Strength is pushed nearby and falls prone. The damage is doubled against objects.

<ins>Drill.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (2D4). Doubled against objects.

<ins>Sonic Blasters.</ins> Each adjacent creature and object immediately in front of the engine take (1D4). They take half damage on a successful save. The damage is doubled against objects.

<span class="alchemy">**Weapon of Pain**. Each of the engine of pain’s weapons can be used by anybody but arming them inflicts 1D6 intelligence damage. </span>

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Engines of Pain are a new monster from DnD 5e found in [Mordenkainen's Tome of Foe](https://5e.tools/book.html#mtf). They are actually my favourite and I love them as is. However, I don't think they need to be purely a duergar thing. — SaltyGoo
