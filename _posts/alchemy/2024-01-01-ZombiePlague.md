<span class="alchemy">**Zombie Plague.** Disease (Body Fluid). You are feverish and cough blood. Every morning, you take 1D4 poison damage. If you reach 0 HP at any time while diseased, you die and are risen as a rabid [zombie](/monsters/zombie). Save every night: on a failure, the poison damage die increases by one size. Success reduces the die size by one. You are cured if the die becomes smaller than a D4.</span>

##### Originated by a [Harpy](/monsters/zombie).
