##### A monster originating from Greek mythology.

_Imagine an human-sized vulture with the chest, arms and face of a woman. Its filthy face is distorded by a maniacal grin revealing needle-like teeth._

Vulture women. A humanoid.

Harpies are stupid, hateful and cowardly. They will harass people for days, only killing them when they are finaly driven mad.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Claw</ins>. The harpy makes a melee attack (1D4 dmg). It can then either fly out of melee range or make another melee attack (1D4 dmd)

<ins>Screech</ins>. The harpy makes a high-pitched scream. Every non-harpy living creature near it must save or be [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/) on their next turn, and [deafened](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/) for 10 minutes.

<ins>Cacophony</ins>. At least 4 harpies start singing in maddening discordant voices. All non-harpy living creatures that can clearly hear them are [confused](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/) until the harpies stop.

## So, You Have Met Harpies?

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Loot Them</summary>
Most harpies have no desire for material possessions besides trinkets from their victims. If you brave the filfth to loot one, roll a D6, you find:

1. Nothing
2. Nothing
3. Nothing. You catch [Harpy shit disease](https://rememberdismove.blogspot.com/2015/06/harpyshaft-dungeon-adventure.html)
4. Couple of copper coins or trinkets not worth more than a mundane object!
5. Dented-to-shit piece of armour. Could be repaired.
6. A [potion](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-perfect-potion-list.html) contaminated with Harpy shit disease

<span class="alchemy">**Harpy Shit Disease.** Disease (Body Fluid). When you act like a shitty person, make an easy save, if you fail, you become a Harpy. Save every night to avoid making the save harder. If the save becomes easier than easy, you are cured. </span>
