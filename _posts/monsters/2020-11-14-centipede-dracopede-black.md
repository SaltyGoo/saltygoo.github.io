*Armored centipede with a poison breath attack. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a spiked, armored centipede as long as a dog, and as black as ebony. It eats organic matter.

Dracopedes cant see well but detects nearby movement.

**Attacks:** Each round, the dracopede can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (x) inflicting additional poison damage (x). If this damage would inflict wounds to the target, it falls asleep instead.

## Salvaging the Body

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<span class="alchemy">**Black Dracospit.** Save or take damage and be poisoned, save again each day to cure. This damage cannot inflict wounds, but causes sleep instead.</span>
