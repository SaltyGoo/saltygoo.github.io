*THIS IS A CLASS FOR TWO PLAYERS PLAYING ONE CHARACTER*

**B:** Selves-Preservation<br>
**C:** Help Me Help You<br>
**D:** Us vs Them<br>

## Half of One
You are one half of a two-headed giant. You and your other half each have created a character with this class, but you share the same body. Because of that, you share HP and inventory, and take the space of two humans. However, you still have control of your own head and one arm: one of you is always awake, but you each can only use one-handed objects.

You must decide together where you move, but you otherwise each play your halves separately. Whenever one of you must make a movement/climb/swim/etc roll, the other must too. One failure means both fail. Coordinating those limbs is hard!

## Collaborate
When your other half would fail something, you can roll one collaboration dice to give them a bonus equal to your roll.

## Selves-Preservation
You can spend one collaboration dice and add it to one of your damage rolls against a thing that has hurt your other half.

## Help Me Help You
When your other half spends their last collaboration dice, you recover one collaboration dice.

## Us vs Them
When your other half attacks, you can attack too.
