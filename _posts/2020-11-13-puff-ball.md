**R**: 120'

A big purple puffball swells into existence at the targeted point until it reaches the size of a football, then promptly explodes into a cloud of toxic spores. Creatures and objects composed of organic matter (including wooden and flesh constructs and corporeal undead) within a 10'x[dice] diameter area take [sum] damage, Save for half. Creatures and objects destroyed by this damage are reduced to nutritious compost.

###### spore + ball
