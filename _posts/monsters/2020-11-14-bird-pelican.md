Sea birds that swallow whole. A large beast.

_Imagine a cart-sized seabird with a long pouch-beak._

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Swallow</ins>. The pelican makes an attempt to grapple a target. On success, the target is stuck in its beak pouch. While there, it cannot use any weapon bigger than a dagger.

<ins>Subdue</ins>. The pelican squishes its beak pouch on its chest to crush whatever is inside (1D4).

<ins>Gulp</ins>. The pelican skims a water pond and fills its pouch with water. As long as it is filled, creatures inside [can't breathe](**url**) or speak.

<ins>Shake</ins>. The pelican violently shakes its head. A creature in its pouch must save or be [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for a round.
