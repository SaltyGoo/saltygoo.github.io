title: Become Disgusting
---
**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

Up to [dice] target creatures smell and taste like garbage for the spell's duration. Most creatures will try to avoid them, or try to fight them last in a battle, but scavengers will be attracted to them. Enchanted creatures will also provoke disgusted reactions in most social interactions

This spell does not affect dead creatures, or creatures who either have no sense of smell, or are used to bad smells (e.g. goblins).

If you invest 4 [dice] in this spell, the effects become permanent.
