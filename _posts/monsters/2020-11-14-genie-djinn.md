title: Genie, Djinn
---

Wish-granting lords of the plane of air. An air elemental.

_Imagine a blue-skinned tall human. Instead of legs, a whirl of blue smoke cracks with magic. Its eyes glow with energy and its voice booms like thunder._

_Universally talented, Deferential arrogance, Tempestuous strength._

| **HD:** 7 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** hard  |

It is **immune** to electricity. 
It **resists** all other damage (because it's an elemental).
It **can** see extremely well.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round spent only flying.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent not moving.
Out of combat, it can cast wind, translocation, reality-shaping and divination-themed **magic**.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Scimitar Whirl</ins>. The djinn makes a melee attack against three targets (1D8).

<ins>Forked Lightning</ins>. The djinn makes a short ranged attack against three targets (1D8).

<ins>Spellcasting</ins>. *Major Illusion, Plane Shift, Polymorph, Summon Air Elemental, Karmic Wish.*

<ins>Tornado</ins>. The djinn creates a tornado anywhere it can see and moves it at a fast pace in one direction. Any creature in its path must save or be sucked in, [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). As long as the djinn holds concentration and sees the tornado, it can move it every turn with every creature inside.
