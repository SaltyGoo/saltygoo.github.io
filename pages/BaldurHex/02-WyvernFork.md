<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

*Unless you arrive from [01 - Cloakwood Grove](/pages/BaldurHex/01-CloakwoodGrove) or [03 - Cloakwood Mines](/pages/BaldurHex/03-CloakwoodMines/), features B and C of this hex are inaccessible and traveling northward from this hex is impossible.*

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Thundering Raeth </span>

The thundering rapids of River Raeth are 50 ft wide and make the area near-uncrossable. The only way to reach deeper into the woods is to find a crossing elsewhere, or brave the currents here.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Wyvern Vista </span>

A big rocky hill that overlooks the canopy. Offers the best panorama of Cloakwood, but is the nesting ground of many local wyverns.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Hamadryad Grove </span>

A hidden, enchanted fay sanctuary where the boundary between the material and dream world are porous.
