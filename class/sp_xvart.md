###### A class inspired by the [5e lore](https://dumpstatadventures.com/blog/deep-dive-the-xvart) for the Xvart and with a nice tip from Halfacon from [SameIsSharkInJapanese](https://sameissharkinjapanese.blogspot.com/2022/10/2000-ad-very-char2terie-halloween.html). Illustration by Kim from [Master the Dungeon](https://www.masterthedungeon.com/low-level-encounter/).

<i>Once upon a time, an greedy god ruled below
He owned everything, yet he wanted to know 
Exactly how much until his vaults overflow

So he tasked wise Xvart to begin tally
For he was well known to never dally

Yet after centuries of counting riches daily
The servant wanted a taste of divine glory

Xvart saw a way out and took it gayly
He had stolen enough to never worry 

And to make sure his crimes never show
replaced himself with a million faux</i>

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Crooked Dagger, and your choice of Stilts, a Wide Net, or the Accounting Book of a place or person you can choose later.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Hiding from the Authority, Accounting, Goblin Diplomacy, and Bat Husbandry.

For every Xvart template you have, you gain _another Xvart nearby_.

**A:** Little Blue Minion, Not the Xvart<br>
**B:** The Wrong Xvart<br>
**C:** Maybe the Xvart?<br>
**D:** The Xvart<br>

## Little Blue Minion
You are 3 foot tall, allowing you to fit through narrow and small spaces. You cannot carry objects bigger than you.

## Not the Xvart
You are a copy of the original Xvart, one of the million decoys created by the fugitive accountant. You are accused of crimes on a mundane and divine scale, yet cant be proven guilty. You benefit from a certain cosmic impunity, yet suffer from a certain universal hostility.
	
If anybody accuses you of something, you become aware of it and can deflect the blame on another Xvart nearby. You can never be accused of having done the same specific thing ever after.

## The Wrong Xvart
If you die and there is another Xvart nearby, you can declare that the dead xvart wasn't you. You then enter the scene as if that turn hadn't happened.

## Maybe the Xvart?
You start every adventure with another Xvart nearby.

## The Xvart
You are secretly the original Xvart, or are you? If anybody accuses you of having any magical or divine powers, you not only lose this ability forever, but you also never had it. All those weird things that might have happened because of this ability before were mere coincidences.
	
Until then, you can recreate the effect of [any spell](/list/spells) with up to 4 spell dice. If you roll a double on your spell dice, a god accuses you of having magic powers.
