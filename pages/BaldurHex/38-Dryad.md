<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for information on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Dryad Falls</span>

This crystalline waterfall drops 200 feet into a small turquoise lake framed by pine trees. Popular among local lovers, a small slippery path has been traced up the cliff to a romantic alcove hidden behind the waterfall.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Great Pine</span>

The tallest pine in the forest is here. Many lumberjacks boast that they will cut it down, but they fear angering the local dryads.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Dire Wolf Den</span>

This mountainside cave is the den of the local pack of dire wolves. They will protect their pups fiercely.
