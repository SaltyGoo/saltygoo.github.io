*Half devil, half humanoid. Handsome, frightening, powerful. Humanoid & Divine.*

<span class="alchemy"> *In demonology, a cambion is the offspring of a woman and an incubus. DnD follows the theme and makes them equally proficient rogue, figther and thieves. This adaptation is based on the DnD 5th edition version, which I think managed to synthetise the bloated 2e one into a functional monster. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine the offspring of a humanoid and a devil. More grandiose than its mortal parent, with goat horns, bat wings and a hot, reddish skin.

**HD:** 5  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / (6) / 8 / 7 / 6 /  <br>
**Resistances:** all <br>
**Armor:** plate <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** reckless <br>

**Spellcasting:** *Alter Self, Command, Detect Magic, Plane Shift,*

Cambions are talented in all social and roguish skills and can see in the dark. Contrary to their divine parents, they can stay in the material world without issue. Most cambions own at least one magic item.

**Attacks:** Each round, the cambion can perform 2 of these actions:

<ins>Flaming Spear.</ins> The cambion makes a melee attack (x), which inflicts both physical and fire damage.

<ins>Fire Bolt.</ins> The cambion makes a ranged attack (x).

<ins>Charm.</ins> A creature that can see the eyes of the cambion must save or be dominated for 1 day. It can save again if it will take damage. A creature that succeeds its save is immune to this ability for 24h.
