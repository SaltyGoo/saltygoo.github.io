A form in stone, such as a statue, is endowed with life, viscera, beating hearts, flesh, and so forth. If the stone was once living, that previous existence is permanently restored. Otherwise, when the spell ends the new life will:
1. Return to stone.
1. Dissolve into a mess of biological waste.
1. Be stolen by an incorporeal soul, demon, or spirit for unpredictable purposes.
