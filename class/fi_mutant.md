Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). If your roll gives you an animal, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for it.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Choose between your Failed Medieval Career, Sewers Life, or Aberrations.

For every Mutant template you have, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

**A:** Font of Flesh, Reactive Mutation<br>
**B:** Evolution<br>
**C:** Gruesome Melding<br>
**D:** Regeneration<br>

## Font of Flesh
You can have as many mutations as your Strength score (they dont take inventory slots). If you would gain a mutation beyond your capacity, you explode, damaging yourself and all nearby creatures for 1d8 damage per 2 mutations you have. You then lose all your mutations and make a new roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Reactive Mutation
When you would be affected by something, you can roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*: You now resist (take half damage or have advantage on your rolls) that type of danger as defined by the Referee as long as you have this mutation. 

## Evolution
When you explode, you can move one of your mutations to your inventory. You dont lose mutations that are in your inventory when you explode.

## Gruesome Melding
You can absorb up to 2 items into your body. If you do, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for each, they are now part of your mutations and become freed once you explode. While an item is part of your body, you do not need a hand to use it. If the item is a piece of armor, it does not hinder your movement.

## Regeneration
When you explode, your body is made anew and you lose all [scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). Enjoy unlimited explosions!
