# Pallonia, Contemplating Nun
She's sitting on a rock, contemplating the waves. Thin, long teeth, blue eyes. Her nun habits are weathered and too big for her.

*"I know why you're here. It's the same reason everyone else comes to see me, and you shall get the same answer..."*

<ins>The Problem</ins> - There are much bigger, cosmic forces at play than local conflicts between bandits and merchants, and nobody is acting on them. The children of a god is roaming the area, bringing chaos in its wake and nervousness in the heaven!

<ins>Wants</ins> - Acknowledgement of the cosmic disturbance, or alternatively be left alone.

<ins>Hates</ins> - Mundane questions, petty questions, selfish questions.

<ins>Quirk</ins> - She *always* thinks on a broader scale than you. She never stops contemplating the waves.

<ins>Stats</ins> - As a *Diviner*.

*Note: I often find players get obsessed with what is directly in front of them. I use NPCs like that to remind them of the scale of the world. Use Pallonia as a tool to inform the players on how close they are to resolving the intrigue of **Sarevok**, **Imoen** and **Irenicus**.*
