title: Blood to Rope
---
R: Touch  D:  [dice] * 10 minutes

You drain your blood into a rope and create 30' of it per point of self-inflicted damage. The rope counts as magical. If you cast this spell with 3 [dice] or more, you can cause the rope to appear anchored to any point you can see, provided the other end can reach your hand.
