title: Swap Senses
---
**R**: Touch **D**: [dice] * 10 minutes

Pick two of the five senses, the target creature swaps them for the duration. This may allow you to “see” via sound, allowing you to see even if blind folded. You could hear sounds via smell, or taste via touch, etc. If an attack would target one sense but you have swapped it, such as a petrifying gaze while you are seeing via scent, you are immune to that ability.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the target, the effect becomes permanent.
