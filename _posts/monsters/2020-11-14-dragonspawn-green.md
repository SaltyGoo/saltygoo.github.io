title: Dragonspawn, Green
---

The horrible result of splicing dragon genes into a humanoid. An aberration.

Imagine a humanoid spliced with green dragon genes. A hulk of muscles and green scales, with bony wings sprouting from its uneven arms. Oh, and with sharp long teeth.

It lives in constant anguish of its unnatural state, hunting humanoids to feel better.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy, surprisingly agile, but its mind clouded by pain <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As an aberration, the dragonspawn *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionaly, they are immune to poison, can hold their breath for 1 hour and have a great sense of smell.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Charge.</ins> The greenspawn bull-rushes its full movement. If the target fails to dodge, it takes damage (2D6), is pushed back and is knocked prone. 

<ins>Rake.</ins> The greenspawn makes two melee attacks (1D6) with its blade-like wings and then jumps back nearby.

<ins>Throw.</ins> The greenspawn attempts to grapple a creature and bite it. On a success, it inflicts bite (1D6) and poison (1D6) damage. The target is then thrown nearby, taking damage (1D6) on impact and falling prone.

<ins>Poison Cloud (recharge 2/6).</ins> The greenspawn exhale poison gas around it, providing total cover. Each creature in the area or ending their turn in the area must make a saving throw vs poison or take poison damage (3D6) and be poisoned until the end of their next turn. The cloud has 1/4 chance of dissipating each turn.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The dragonspawns are a monsters that appear in the DnD 3e module the [Red Hand of Doom](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28797/Red-Hand-of-Doom-3e). A rare appearance of mutants in modern DnD, but of course they are dragon themed. I made the green ones like sewer monster boss fight. â€” SaltyGoo
