---

Powerful spirit of self-doubt. A fey.

You didn't see the snake first, because its mirror-like scales made it blend in the background. Similarly, it's lenght is hard to grasp: two or three horses long? You dont have time to wonder as you see your own face at the end of the serpentine body, unhinging its jaws as it looks at you.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as mail <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong and sturdy, intelligent and risk averse <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairie, the muttering serpent *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all its abilities and spells for a round. 

Additionally, muttering serpent have mirror like scales that make it functionally invisible when it doesn't move. The muttering serpent speaks telepathically can also read surface thoughts. Because of that, it only speaks in questions and in the voice of the person they are talking to make them doubt and split their group. It can communicate with eight person simultaneously.
