**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

Trace your Sigil on a hand mirror, which proves to be of great defense against other spellcasters: anyone casting a noxious spell while seeing their own image in the mirror will have the spell flung back at them.

Holding the mirror correctly does not impede actions but requires a free hand and minimum of effort: you can change the reflected subject as they do other actions. The mirror reflects [dice] spell dices before losing its powers. Reflecting a spell reflected by another heka mirror provokes a [Catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).
