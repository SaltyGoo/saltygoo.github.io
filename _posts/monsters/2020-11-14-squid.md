<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 4 bags of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

Squids are delicious.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
