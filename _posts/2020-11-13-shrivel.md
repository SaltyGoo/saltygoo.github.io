**R**: 60'  **D**: [sum] rounds

You seemingly age a target by many years. If it fails a save, it loses half of its maximum HP and has disadvantage on physical rolls. When the spell ends, the lost HP and Strength returns. If you cast this spell with 4 [dice] against a single target, the effect is permanent.

If you cast this spell on yourself, the duration is until you want it to end.
