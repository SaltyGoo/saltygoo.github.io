R: 60'  D: [dice] x 10 minutes

Target creature smells and tastes like garbage for the spell's duration. Most creatures will try to avoid it, or try to fight it last in a battle, but scavengers will be attracted to it. Enchanted creature will also provoke disgusted reactions in most social interactions

This spell does not affect dead creatures, or creatures who either have no sense of smell, or are used to bad smells (e.g. goblins).
