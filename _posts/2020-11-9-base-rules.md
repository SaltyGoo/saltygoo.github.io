# **How to Play**

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to **roll** a 20-faced die and add a number from your character sheet to the roll. If the situation is **easy**, the result must be above 10 to succeed, if it's **normal**, you have to beat 15, and if it's **hard**, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on. 

Sometimes, the referee might tell you that the situation gives you **advantage** or **disadvantage**. Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite.

That's it!

# **Creating a Character**

You have three main stats: **Fortitude**, **Dexterity**, and **Willpower**. Roll 1D6+2 for each to determine their value.

You also have as many **Hit Points** as your Fortitude score.

You can have as many things in your **Inventory** as twice your Fortitude score. <br>
You can have as many things in your **Psyche** as twice your Willpower score.

Choose a [**Character Class**](https://saltygoo.github.io/classes/). Add the class’s starting equipment to your Inventory, its skills and spells to your Psyche and the class' _Template A_ abilities to your character sheet.

Voilà!

# Stats & Skills

Your stats and skills cannot be higher than 10.

<ins>**Fortitude**</ins> represents your physical prowess. You roll it for strength and endurence-related feats.

<ins>**Dexterity**</ins> represents your grace and reflexes. You roll it for feats like climbing, jumping and runnning away, and also to dodge attacks0 and hit things.

<ins>**Willpower**</ins> represents your mind and personality. You roll it for social interactions, but also to resist spells and overwhelming emotions such as fear.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Stat</i></summary>
*Beau is running away from a troll. He rolls a D20 and adds his Dexterity for a total of 17. This is higher than 15 and means that Beau is out of reach in another location of his choice. However, Gretchen, Beau's ally, rolled 12. That means she hasn't escaped the troll, and both of them will have to keep fighting in the next room in the dungeon.*
</details>

A <ins>**Skill**</ins> can be anything (flower arrangement, swordplay, etc.) and starts with a value of 5. When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you to use if it would thematically make sense. Your skills are stored in your **Psyche**.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Skill</i></summary>
*Beau has 3 points of Willpower and 5 points of a skill named "Swamp Dweller". When trying to parley with a troll, the referee asks him to roll Willpower, but Beau argues that his Swamp Dweller skill makes as much sense to use. The referee agrees and Beau adds 5 to his roll instead of 3.*
</details>

<ins>**Hit Points**</ins> (or HP) is the amount of damage you can take before getting [Wounded](#dying--healing).

<ins>**Armor**</ins> is the amount of damage you ignore when an attack hits you. You have 0 armor by default.

---

# Inventory & Psyche

<ins>**Inventory**</ins>. You have as many slots as twice your Fortitude. Inventory slots can be filled with objects, but is also filled with the Scars and mutations you gain along the way. You gain Scars when you get [wounded](#dying--healing) and can only be removed by magic.

Small items like potions and daggers can be stacked in your inventory in packs of 3 of the same type. It takes your turn to retrieve an item during combat unless it is in your first 3 slots.

<ins>**Psyche**</ins>.You have as many slots as twice your Willpower. Psyche slots can be filled with Skills, Spells, Followers and Beliefs, but also with emotional scars you gain along the way. You gain scars when you get [Wounded](#dying--healing).

You cannot go above your psyche slot limit, but you can always forget a Skill, a Spell, or a Belief, or send a follower back home. You cant, however get rid of a scar like that.

You can have as many **Beliefs** as you want, and can change and add more of them each time you level up. At the end of a game session, if you have taken a risk for one of your beliefs, you can increase one of your skills by 1. If a Skill reaches a score of 10 this way, you can remove one emotional scar.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Belief</i></summary>
*Gretchen is figthing a dangerous troll. Her teammate Beau decides to leave his hiding spot to come to her rescue because he believes in selflessness. At the end of the session, he can increase one of his skills by 1 as a reward for having acted upon his Belief.*

Some items like **torches** have a finite use, represented by a D6. After 10 minutes of usage, roll the die. On a result of 1, the item is getting closer to depletion and the D6 becomes a D4. When you roll a 1 on the D4, you only have one use of the item before its depleted.

This system can be used for **ammunitions** too, in that case, instead of 10 minutes of usage, you roll after each battle where it was used.

# Combat

<ins>**Turn Order:**</ins> You act before the monsters unless they have surprised you.

<ins>**Your Turn:**</ins> You can move nearby, speak and do one other action, like casting a spell or attacking.

<ins>**Attacking:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the attack is easy, normal or hard to hit. Roll Dexterity. If you hit, roll your weapon’s damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it. A die roll of 20 on an attack means double damage.

_On the monsters' turn, they might attack you. In this case, you'll have to dodge._

<ins>**Dodging:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the attack is easy, normal or hard to dodge. Roll Dexterity. A die roll of 1 on an dodge means double damage.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Combat</i></summary>
*Gretchen is figthing a dangerous troll. She acts first. On her turn, she yells at her teammate Beau to stop being a coward, swings her sword at the troll, and moves to the edge of a pit, hoping to lure the monster into a precarious position. The referee tells to make a normal attack roll, so she rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity hoping to get above 15. The result is 18, it's a hit! Her sword inflicts 1D8 points of damage to the troll, who is infuriated.*

*It's the troll's turn! The referee announces that the monster chases her to the edge of the pit and swings its club at her. She must dodge! She rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity. 15! It is not enough to avoid the troll's powerfull blow. The referee rolls the monster's damage: 8. Gretchen loses that many Hit Points, reach 0. She starts dying.*

# Dying & Healing

<ins>**Dying:**</ins> When you reach 0 Hit Points, you start dying. While you are dying, you gain a **Wound** at the end of each of your turns. If you reach 10 Wounds, you die. Each point of damage you take while dying also gives you an extra Wound. 

You can spend your turn's action to make a hard Fortitude roll, and any ally that can reach you with the appropriate Skill or tool can spend theirs making a hard Willpower roll to stabilize you. On a success, you stop dying and have 1 HP. You also stop dying if you recover HP any other way.

This does not heal your accumulated Wounds. When you stop dying, you gain a **Scar**. You choose wether the scar will take an Inventory slot or a Psyche slot. It  cannot be easily removed. However, it makes all your rolls against the danger that puts you in that situation easy rolls.

<ins>**Healing:**</ins> A 8 hours rest heals all HP losses and consumes 1 ration for the team.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical happens when you end an adventure in a safe location with healers.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Dying</i></summary>
*Gretchen is dying from a troll attack. On her turn, she calls her ally Beau for help and trys to recover. She rolls 19 on her Fortitude roll. Failure! She gains one Wound.*

*Beau arrives at the scene. He has bandages and could try to stop the bleeding, but the troll is still there, and one hit from it could kill Gretchen. He decides to try pushing the troll down the pit instead, at least to distract it. Success! But on her next turn, Beau fails her hard Fortitude roll again, she now has 2 wounds. Beau attempts to save her using bandages and succeeds his hard Willpower roll! Gretchen stops dying, but still has 2 wounds until the end of the adventure.*

*Gretchen has a new Scar. She decides it is going to take an Inventory slot. From now on, she wont be caught off-guard by a troll. All her rolls against them become easy.*

# Leveling Up

In your adventures you will find objects, the most precious of which are Treasures. By spending a Treasure carousing, a character can level up. It gains +2 HP and you can select a new class template (up to 4 total).

Choose a stat, increase it by 1 (up to 10).

After level 4, you get 1 Mastery point instead of any template or bonus.

<ins>Mastery:</ins> You gain a Mastery point when you level up beyond level 4 or bring a skill or a stat to 10. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting a nearby ally at a rate of 1 point for 1 point.
