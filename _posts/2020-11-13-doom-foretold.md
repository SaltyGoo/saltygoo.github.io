As you make a bold statement about someone’s future, your Sigil brands it in a discreet location. You state [dice] ways the target will not die. From now on, if the target would die from one of these causes, it gets one one incurable Wound instead. This wound does not provoke dying. If this Sigil was to be removed for another reason that the sigiled person’s death, a catastrophe would happen.
