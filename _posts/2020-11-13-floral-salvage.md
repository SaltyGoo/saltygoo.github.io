**R**: Touchâ€ƒ

As you touch a target, flowers erupt from its wounds. It takes [dice] damage for every hit points it is missing. If this damage kills the target, its corpse is entirely consumed by plant growth, and turns into a beautiful flower-covered tree measuring [sum] feet. A save is allowed to halve the damage.
