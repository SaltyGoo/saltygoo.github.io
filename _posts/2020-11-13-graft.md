**R**: Touch **D**: [dice] hours

You may graft up to [dice] loose organic body parts (i.e., arms, legs, ears) to a target, and have them function for the duration. Unwilling targets may save. Afterwards, the target takes [dice] non-lethal damage for each grafted part, as they rot into muck.

The duration of the spells can be permanent if you inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the target.
