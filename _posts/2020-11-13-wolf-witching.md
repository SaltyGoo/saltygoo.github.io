title: Wolf Witching

**D**: [Sigil](spells/#lexicon)

The wolf witching is a powerful curse to have on one’s home. You must fashion a fetish out of wolf fur, deer blood and rabbit guts, trace your Sigil on it, and then incorporate some hair or blood of the victim. The spell becomes effective once the fetish is left, possibly hidden or buried, in the victim’s home: and soon wolves will start to roam the area. A lone wolf the first day, two the second day and so on, until the total number of wolves attracted is equal [sum]. The wolves are not automatically aggressive but have no tolerance for shenanigans.
