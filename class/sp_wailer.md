Wailers, also called professional mourners, death watches, rudaalis or moirologists, are hired to ostentatiously display sadness during funerary processions. Their performances amplify the importance of the deceased and help the truly sad process grief.

For every Wailer template you have, you gain a new **Wail** and can target an additional creature with them.

**A:** Strength Through Suffering, Theatre of Sadness<br>
**B:** Procession<br>
**C:** Death Watch<br>
**D:** Banshee
<br>

## Strength Through Suffering
You have +1 HP per [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) and [Trauma](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) you have (you gain a Scar when you reach 0HP and you gain a Trauma when one of your companions die. Scars go in your inventory and Traumas go in your psyche).

## Theatre of Sadness
You can cry on cue. On your turn, you can perform a Wail and targets of your choice must save or empathically act accordingly this turn. You can target as many creatures as you have Wailer templates with this ability. Mindless creatures are immune. Animals and ghosts don't get a save. This is not a spell, itâ€™s theatre.

### Wails
Wails go in your psyche. You gain one per Wailer template. 

- _Throw yourself on the ground in despair (you are prone)._ Blinded by despair, the targets will attempt a reckless action to achieve their higher goal with total disregard to their own safety.
- _Throw your empty palms upward and scream at the sky_. Blinded by melancholy, the targets will lose motivation in their current higher goal, instead attempting a self-preserving action.
- _Flog your naked back in penitent submission._ Blinded by bitterness, the targets will attempt a cynical action to achieve their ambition with total disregard for hierarchy or alliances or social conventions.
- _Loudly cry and tear tufts of your own disheveled hair._ Blinded by self-pity, the targets will lose all ego and their next action will be made for the sake of someone else they fear or love.
- _Stand in dignified silence and fiercely ring your bell once as a single tear runs down your cheek._ Blinded by gravitas, the targets will attempt to act with the utmost pomp and respect for this serious situation.

## Procession
As long as you constantly repeat the same **Wail**, creatures who failed their initial save continue to be affected by it without needing to be targeted again each turn. Every 10 minutes you do so, you must save or lose your voice. If you lose your voice, you cannot wail for 1 hour.

## Death Watch
When you see a named character die, you can begin a passionate, loud eulogy. As long as you do so, it is as if the character was still there as a ghost, immortal, immaterial, and acting according to your wishes. You must save every 10 minutes of the eulogy or lose your voice.

## Banshee
Creatures do not get a save to resist your theatre of sadness. When you die, you become a ghost follower of your next character or one of your companions. As a ghost, you have no inventory slots and cannot inflict or take mundane damage.
