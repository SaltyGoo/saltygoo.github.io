title: Universal Knot
---
**R**: 60’ 		**D**:  [dice]*10 minutes

You make a knot with a piece of rope and [dice] non-living objects close and/or become locked. If the object is a door, chest, or similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing through it and then trapping them. It then requires a fortitude of [dice]*3 to open it. 

Alternatively, this spell can be cast on a creature’s orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another Save at the end of each of its turns.
