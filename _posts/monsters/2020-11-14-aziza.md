Friendly underbush fruit fairy people. A fey.

Imagine a leafy, child-like, hairy creature with beady eyes. It dresses in leave cloaks.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile, wise, and charismatic <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairie, the aziza *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the aziza can speak with all animals and plants, is hard to spot in a forest, and can see in the dark. It often rides animals.

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Apotropaism, Druidcraft.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Club</ins>. The aziza makes a melee attack (1D4).

<ins>Spellcasting (1)</ins>. *Charm Animal, Detect Evil, Cloud of Leaves, Summon Fruits, Protection from Evil, Stick to Snake*

<ins>Snort Luck Powder</ins> (1/day). The aziza cant get  below 1 hit point for 10 minute, or until it rolls a 20 or a pair.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

You find a stick and ...(Roll as many times as the HD of the monster)

1. Nothing.
1. A fresh fruit.
1. A tiny blowgun.
1. A tiny leaf cloak.
1. A face-fruit.
1. A pouch of luck powder.

Powder Luck is made by grinding face-fruits which are grown from the bodies of humanoids. 

Eating an aziza feeds for a day and provides the effects of a greater restoration spell. It also makes all animals from the area permanently dislike you. The slight buzz might gives a wizard the inspiration to create a spell with the word *Fruit*.

<span class="alchemy">**Luck Powder.** For 10 minutes, you cannot roll below 10. For a session after your first snort, you must carry an aziza on your shoulder (taking an inventory slot). You get two azizas after your second snort, etc. You and fairies are the only ones who can see or hear them. They are chatty.</span>

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The aziza, according to Beninese mythology, are small friendly fairies living in anthills. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) is what inspired me. I gave them my typical fey resistances, a fire spell (as they are said to have given the knowledge of fire to humans) and adapted their luck gift ability into a more gonzo drug-themed equivalent. — SaltyGoo
