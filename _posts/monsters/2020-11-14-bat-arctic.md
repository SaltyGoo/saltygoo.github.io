##### Illustration by Salty Goo. Monster inspired by the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium).


A fluffy white bat with a freezing venom. Arctic Bats follow blizzards, hiding among the snowflakes. They harass their preys until they freeze before eating them.  A tiny scavenging beast. 

_Imagine a tiny screeching puff of white fur with grey-blue bat wings._

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of silver in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Arctic bat fur is very fluffy, but a huge amount of bats must be skinned to make a coat, making it very expensive. [Arctic bat venom](/2024/01/01/arctic-bat-venom/) is valued as a food preserver and as a weapon.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
