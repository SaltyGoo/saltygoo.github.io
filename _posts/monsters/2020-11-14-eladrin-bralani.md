title: Eladrin, Bralani
---

A wrathful and sad greater ur-elf. A fey.

Imagine a humanoid of towering beauty, its skin in hues of frost and its eyes darkened by deep sadness. One crystalline tear slides on its left cheek. Its lean, muscular arm tenses as it readies an arrow.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** leather <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** better than you in any way, but exceptionally strong and supernaturally agile <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As a fairy, the eladrin *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the eldrin can teleport to any location in sight.

Bralanis specifically embody the roughness of creeping winter: they are immune to cold and are expert hunters. They can see clearly kilometres away.

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Divination, Cryomancy, Tempestomancy

**Attacks (1/round) (fey)**

<ins>Scimitar Flurry</ins>. The eladrin makes three melee attacks (1D6), then teleports nearby.

<ins>Triple Ice Arrows</ins>. The eladrin makes three ranged bow attacks (1D6), then teleports nearby. One hit target is frozen to the ground unless it saves.

<ins>Spellcasting (3).</ins> *Wind Wall, Mirror Image, Control Weather.*

<ins>Elemental Form.</ins> The eladrin turns into a whirling wind, allowing it to fly. As a gaseous creature, the eladrin cant be petrified or grappled, be hit by mundane weapons and can fit into any hole. However, winds can hurt it like a sword.

**Attacks (1/round) (elemental)**

<ins>Whirlwind</ins>. The eladrin makes three melee attacks with reach (1D6), on a hit, anything smaller than a horse must save or be pushed back nearby.

<ins>Fey Form.</ins> The eladrin turns back into a fey, allowing it to teleport.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Eladrins are a Planescape creation that changed a lot in the 4th and 5th editions to become an elf variant. Originally being the chaotic good mirror of baatezu-devils and tanar'ri-demons, they had a pretty stiff hierarchy of power, the bralani being among the strongest. In 5e, they are simply the winter-time version of eladrins. I tried to merge the two into this extremely dangerous scorned avenger. It was also important to make them as relatively fragile as they are deadly. As elves should be. â€” SaltyGoo
