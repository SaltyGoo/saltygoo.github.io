<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Tiefling template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

## Consume Soul
Hearts are like cocaine to you. When you eat a fresh heart, you gain advantage on any roll as long as it is for a selfish, cocky and petty action for the next hour. For the following hour, you have disadvantage on all rolls that are not for  a selfish, cocky and petty action.
