*Amphibious, diseased death bats. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The kongamato is a cryptid from Zambia described as a giant pterodactyl whose name means "boat-turner". [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) chooses to make it a bat and a carrier of diseases. I like that. DnD needs much more diseases. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Dark red and with thick leathery wings, the kongamato smells of swamp water. Its amphibious nature explains its name, which means “boat toppler” in the local tongue.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 6 / 8 / 6 / 1 / 6 / 4  <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast, swim average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark.

**Echolocation:** As long as it can hear, the bat can detect invisible creatures.

**Attacks:** Each round, the kongamato can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Bite</ins>. The kongamato makes a melee attack with disadvantage (2x). 

<ins>Claws</ins>.  The kongamato makes a melee attack (x). On a hit, the target must save against disease or catch eye rot.

<span class="alchemy"> **Eye Rot**: Disease. You have a maximum vision of 50'. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: -10’ max vision. </span>

## Salvaging the Body

Kongamato fur is waterproof. You would still need the skin of two to make an outfit. Its guano or flesh can be used as a carrier of Eye Rot disease.
