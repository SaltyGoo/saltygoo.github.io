Brain sucking giant flea. A beast.

Imagine a cat-sized flea with a green iridescent exoskeleton. A long probe coils from its mouth.

**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** slow <br>

Giant flayers do not see well but can detect movement nearby. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 20’ without momentum.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Giant flayer shell can be used for armor but has 1-6 chance to break on each hit. A more common use would be to ground it to make a green iridescent dye.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The giant flayer beetle is an orginal creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/08/new-oebx1e-monster-giant-flayer-beetle.html). When adapting it to the GLoG, I made it slightly less sturdy but a bit more reliable: the original was only threatening when rolling a critical hit, this one does intelligence damage more often. — SaltyGoo
