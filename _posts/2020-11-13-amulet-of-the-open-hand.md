D: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

Trace a hand on an item and complete it with your Sigil to create a powerful amulet against malisons. When the bearer of the item fails a save against hostile magic, they can roll again. If the save is now passed, a crack appears on the amulet. The amulet crumbles after [dice] such cracks.
