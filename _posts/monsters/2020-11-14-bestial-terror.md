title: Bestial Terror
---

Centaur ghost of doom. An undead.

Imagine the ghost of a centaur wearing a terrifying faceless spiked helm. Whenever its hooves hit the floor, it echoes like thunder and black smoke rises from the ground.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong and sturdy <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As an undead creature, the bestial terror does not starve to death, breathe, sleep or tire and cant be poisoned. As an ethereal creature, the bestial terror is immune to damage from a nonmagical source, as well as grapples and petrification. However, direct sunlight makes it lose all resistances and immunities.

Additionally, it can see in the dark and its hooves make a terrible noise when it gallops. Each creature who hears must save or be frightened. A creature is immune to this effect for 24h after a successful save.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Charge</ins>. If it has the space to maneuver, the bestial terror charges a target with its hooves and pike. If the target doesn’t dodge, it takes (2D6) damage and is knocked prone.

<ins>Pike Drag</ins>. The bestial terror makes one melee attack (1D8) and may move nearby with the target.

<ins>Trample</ins>. The bestial terror makes two melee attacks (1D6) against different targets.

<ins>Longbow</ins>. The bestial terror makes two ranged attacks (1D6).

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Originally named the bestial beast by its creator [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), the bestial terror is basically a spectral centaur. On top of the spectral trample, I added typical centaur attacks: it was really important for me that the specters were able to drag mortals to the underworld with their pikes. — SaltyGoo
