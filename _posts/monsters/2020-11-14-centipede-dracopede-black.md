<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<span class="alchemy">**Black Dracospit.** Save or take 1D6 damage and be poisoned, save again each day to cure. If this damage would bring you below 1 HP, you fall asleep for 12 hours instead.</span>

Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste.
