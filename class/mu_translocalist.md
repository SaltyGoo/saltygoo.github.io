The Translocalist is a type of [Magic User](/class/magic-user)

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A spellbook that doubles as a star map, ink and quill, compass.

<ins>Spell List</ins><br>
Any from the [translocation](/spells#translocation) school.

<ins>Perk</ins><br>
If you can see an astral body, you recover your spell dices on a roll of 1 to 4.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
You need a compass to cast your spells. As such, you cannot carry iron objects.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- Before your roll MD for a spell, declare “odds” or “evens”. If the [sum] rolled matches your prediction, heal 1 HP or increase the damage dealt by the spell by 1.
- You can magnetize small metal objects like coins for 10 minutes. Useful when you need a compass.
- You can create a faint beam of light from your finger and know the exact distance between you and what you point (basically a lazer pointer). If you point it in a magical portal, it tells you the rough location: astral sea, elemental plane, dream world, land of the dead, hell, parallel univers, far abyss, etc.
