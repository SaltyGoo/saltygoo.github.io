**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

When violence is the only way. You take [dice] damage as you extract your blood to forge a one-handed melee weapon of fortune. This damage cannot bring you below 0 HP. The weapon deals 1D8 damage plus the number of wounds you have. You (and only you) have advantage on your attack rolls with the weapon.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the weapon becomes permanent.
