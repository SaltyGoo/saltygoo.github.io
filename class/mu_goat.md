<ins>Perk</ins><br>
Instead of each SD, you have a witch follower with 1 SD. Add they to your entourage. When you would take damage, one of your witches can sacrifice themself to take the hit in stead of your goatly magesty. If one of your witches dies, you need to spend a night in a settlement to attract a new one. Witches have 4 in all their stats and 2 HP.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
You are a goat, you cannot use items yourself (your witches can), and you can only talk (through telepathy) to your witches.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- You can cause a minor horrible omen to appear. Statues weep blood, ashes spell out "DOOM", a bird falls out of the air dead, small children sing eerie songs, etc. Can't deal damage or provide some handy secondary benefit, like triggering a trap, but it will probably scare the bejeesus out of someone.
- You can appear as a naked goat-headed humanoid for 1 minute, but only to one person (others still see you as a goat).
- If you have a witch and are in a dark spot, you can take 10 minutes to cease existing, except for your red eyes glowing in the dark. You can fade back by walking from the shadows, from behind a tree, from tall grass, etc.
