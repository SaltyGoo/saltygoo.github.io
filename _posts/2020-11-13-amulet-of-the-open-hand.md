D: Sigil

Trace a hand on an item and complete it with your Sigil to create a powerful amulet against malisons. When the bearer of the item fails a save against hostile magic, they can apply a bonus equal to [dice]: if the save is now passed, the spell expires. The talisman effect does not stack with other warding bonuses.
