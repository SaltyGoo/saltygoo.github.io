**R**: Touch  **D**: [dice] hours

Target is bedecked in crystalline jewelry and fondant in the form of an elaborate formal costume. They gain [dice] armor (does not stack with other worn armor) and are sufficiently dressed for a ball. (The transformation is pretty much just like Cinderella)

If you also invested 4 [dice] or more into this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the dress, the duration becomes permanent.
