**D**: 10 minutes

You create 1D4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. 

When an attack would hit you, roll a D6 to see if it hits you or an image. If you roll below the number of images, the attack hits an image instead of you. If the attack would have inflicted damage, the hit image vanishes. Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to vanish.
