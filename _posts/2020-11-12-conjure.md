R: 15â€™		D: [dice]*10 minutes

You call a creature from another dimension. If a particular true name is known, it may be intoned during the casting of this spell, and the named creature will come, but the veil may also be rent without care for what will emerge. You may control any summoned entity of [dice] or less HD with concentration, but otherwise the standard reaction roll and negotiating procedures apply.
