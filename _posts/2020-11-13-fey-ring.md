R: Touch		D: [sum] days 

You trace a circle in wet dirt and, after one full night, toadstools have grown on its edge. 

Crossing the threshold reveals a dozen of pixies and korrigans dancing, and all who enter are compelled to join the revels for what seems like a few blurry moments. When they exit, [dice] days have passed in the real world.

Alternatively, treasures and children can be brought as offerings in the circle to have access to a local fey prince’s court for the same duration.
