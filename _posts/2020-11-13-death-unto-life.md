**R**: Touch

You bring a corpse back to life. A body missing parts will be brought to life missing those parts, miraculously alive for [dice] days should they miss vital organs. The departed is brought back to life at 1 HP, level zero and bedridden until they rest the the same amount of time they spent beyond the veil. Thereafter will recover 1 class template per week, up to [dice] templates. They cannot level up until they have recovered.

After casting this spell you are profoundly enervated and must roll a D4. If you roll higher than [dice], you fall in a coma for a session. If you roll a 4, you provoke a [catastrophe](/class/magic-user#spells).
