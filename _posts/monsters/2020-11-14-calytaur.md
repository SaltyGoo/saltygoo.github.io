*Pigfolk or boarfolk. Humanoid.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The original creation of [Richard J Leblanc](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-monster-calytaur.html) refers to the calydonian boar of greek myths. I personnaly used them more as bacchanalian hillbilly cultists pig people in my games. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a humanoid covered in mud and with the face of a pig. It stinks of feces and dirt.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 5 / 7 / 3 / 6 / 4 <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Calytaurs can smell in the dark as if they were seeing.

**Relentless:** If an attack would reduce the calytaur to 0 HP, it can roll 1D6 and reduce the damage by as much.

**Attacks:** Each round, the calytaur can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Great-Axe.</ins> The calytaur makes one melee attack (x).

<ins>Charge.</ins> The calytaur moves all its movement in a straight line and makes a melee attack (x), on a hit, a target with a lower strength falls prone.
