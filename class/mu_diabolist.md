<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A black goat. A forked dagger. A capirote. A spell book, a quill, but no ink.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Secret Cultist, Lazy Student, or Corrupted Courtesan.

For every Diabolist template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and **[Diabolic Spell](/spells/#diabolism)**.

**A:** Diabolic Spells, Doomed Pact, Signs of the Devil<br>
**B:** Sinful <br>
**C:** +1 Sin <br>
**D:** Dark Reward <br>

## Diabolic Spells
Diabolists get a second random spell from the [diabolist school](/spells/#diabolism) at level 1. They’re stored in spell books and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<summary>How GLOG spells and doom work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Diabolist template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).
</details>

Because of the taboo you've broken as a diabolist, you also gain a Doom Point each time you roll a 6 on a Spell Dice.

## Doomed Pact
You can clear all your [doom] by performing a random obligation for a devil (roll 1D8 on both the obligation and sin tables):

## Signs of the Devil
- When you enter a room, all lights flicker and other people's pets become aggressive to you.
- You and your possessions are unharmed by any fires smaller than a campfire.
- You can see through the eyes of goats that you’ve touched as long as you know where they are. One at a time.

## Sinful
If you have chosen to go down the path of dealing with devils, it is because of your own weakness. Choose the sin that brought you here:

- **Wrath**. You can inflict [doom] fire damage to any target you can see. You gain a _Doom Point_ if it survives, and lose one if it dies.
- **Sloth**. You can sacrifice skill slots to gain new [followers](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html) when you are in town. Each skill you have increases your [doom] by 1.
- **Envy**. Once per day, you can make a copy of a hand-held object or vestment owned by someone else you can see. You gain a _Doom Point_ every time you use it.
- **Pride**. You can reroll any D20 you roll. Each time you fail a reroll, you gain a _Doom Point_.
- **Gluttony**. Eating a daily ration removes a _Doom Point_. Eating five daily rations in a day cures 1 Wound. You gain 3 _Doom Points_ every day.
- **Greed**. Each inventory slot taken by a [Valuable or a Treasure](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#treasures) increases your HP by 1. You gain a _Doom Point_ every time one leaves your inventory.
- **Lust**. Sentient creatures with less HP than your [doom] are overwhelmed by you. They must save to attack, hurt, or say anything bad about you as long as you dont attack them. 

## Dark Reward
Here's the reward you bargained for. You get those related to your two sins. Hope everything goes fine!

- **Wrath**. One person, object, or building of your choice explodes. Everybody interested hates you for it.
- **Sloth**. Your spirit leaves your body behind, which becomes completely helpless. You are permanently [astrally projecting](/2020/11/13/astral-projection/) within 40' of it.
- **Envy**. Get any one thing you are aware of. Everybody knows you have it.
- **Pride**. Erase any mistake or humiliation from your past. You now fumble on rolls of 1 or 2 at the referee's discretion.
- **Gluttony**. You can eat _anything_. You can never eat the same thing twice.
- **Greed**. You gain 1 000 big bags of gold. You cant spend them.
- **Lust**. You have an extra life after this one. You cannot say no to an offer of a new experience.
