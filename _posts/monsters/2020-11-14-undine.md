*Water elementals that long for the chaos of a mortal life. Elemental.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Adapting the undine was difficult: like most elementals, the [DnD version](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elemchfw.html) of the creature is pretty unimaginative in both shape and ability (its a stronger water weird with spells). In this case however, the real life counterpart of the myth is fascinating: not only is it at the origin of the concept of an [elemental creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elemental), but also the inspiration behind the story of the Little Mermaid. I decided to take the powers of the DnD creature and flavor it as the original myth. — SaltyGoo* </span>

The Undine has two forms: a humanoid, either childish and ghostly or adult and sensual, its skin the color of a stormy wave or frothy waters and hair that is liquid, or an amorphous blob of water with multiple apendages. It speaks like a glass harp.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 8 / 6 / 5 / 4 / 7 <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average, swim fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The undine is made of pure water: it can squeeze through any hole and is invisible while submerged. If an undine (or any fey or elemental) gets a true-love's kiss from a mortal, it permanently loses all its resistances and becomes mortal. However, it shares a soul with its lover and will thus be eternaly reincarned.

**Water:** On its turn, if the undine is not in contact with water, it takes 1D4 points of damage. If it is hit by cold damage, it is slowed for a round.

**Shape Change:** The undine can change shape between a blob of water and a humanoid at will. It only has a walking speed if its in humanoid form, and a swim speed in blob form. Its attacks are also different.

**Blob Attacks:** Each round, the undine in blob shape can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Slam</ins>. The undine makes a melee attack (x) with a water tentacle which can reach anywhere nearby.

<ins>Grapple</ins>. The undine makes a grapple attack against any nearby target. A grappled target cannot breathe.

<ins>Choke</ins>. The undine inflicts constitution damage (x) to a grappled target. 

**Humanoid Attacks:** Each round, the undine in blob shape can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Cast Spell</ins>. *Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Dust to Water, Geas*

<ins>Freezing Touch</ins>. The undine makes a melee attack (x).
