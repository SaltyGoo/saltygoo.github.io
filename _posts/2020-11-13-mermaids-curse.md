**R**: 30'    **D**: [sum] rounds

You bind a creature to the sea: it can no longer [breathe](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) outside of water. Creatures of higher HD than [dice] are allowed a save to resist.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
