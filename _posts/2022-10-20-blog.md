These are some of the various byproducts that pop off when I adapt a random DnD [monster](list/monsters) to the Glog.

1. <b>Adarna Guano</b>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Ointment that petrifies sleeping creatures.</summary>
_The [adarna bird](/monsters/bird-adarna) is as elusive as it is beautiful, and many moral fables have been written about vain parvenus dying on their quest to capture it.

<summary>Corrosive Antifreeze Liquid.</summary>

</details>

1. <b>Barbazu Beard Wax</b>
<details markdown="1">

1. <b>Basilisk Eye</b>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Miniature Elemental Earth Portal</summary>

<summary><b>Black Dracospit</b></summary>
_Harvested from a rare species of [armored spitting centipedes](/monsters/centipede-dracopede-black), black dracospit only requires contact with bare skin have effect. For this reason, many alchemists from the underdark wear head-to-toe wrappings when handling it._

<span class="alchemy"> **Vyderac Pheromones**. Contact poison. So itchy, a sprayed target must save each round until they succeed three times or are washed, during which time they cannot focus on any task that extends beyond 1 turn.
