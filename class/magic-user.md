<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Depends on your magic school.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Depends on your magic school.

For every Magic User template you have, you gain one extra Spell Dice.

**A:** Identify, School, Spells <br>
**B:** Call Familiar <br>
**C:** Second Sight <br>
**D:** Arcane Communion <br>

## Identify
By licking an object, you can tell whether or not it is magical.

## School
[Wizard](/class/magic-user/wizard), [Cleric](/class/magic-user/cleric), [Diabolist](/class/magic-user/diabolist), [Elf](/class/magic-user/elf),  [Necromancer](/class/magic-user/necromancer), [Tiefling](/class/magic-user/tiefling).

<ins>Spell List</ins><br>
Every School has a list of spells associated with it. You roll randomly in it each time you take a Magic User template. You must quest to gain other spells.

<ins>Perk/Drawback</ins><br>
Every School give a passive bonus/penalty.

<ins>Cantrips</ins><br>
Every School give minor magical abilities you can use as often as you like.

## Spells
They’re stored in scrolls/books and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.

You start out with two spells. Every time you gain a Magic User template, you gain a new spell, rolled randomly. You can also spend Treasures to copy new spells in your book.

<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Magic User template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to Catastrophe.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

## Call Familiar

One of your spells becomes your sentient friend. You may choose a single spell you know: it becomes a friendly tiny creature of the shape you like. That creature is now part of your entourage and can cast themselve for free at will albeit with a [dice] and a [sum] of 1. You cannot cast the spell yourself anymore, but you can always lend some of your SD to your familiar to boost its power. If your familiar would die, you lose the spell forever. It has as many hit points as you have Magic User templates and is immune to one type of damage of your choice.

Familiars can *provide a service once per day*. For each service, you owe the familiar one favor. They can be pretty nasty tasks, but failing to fulfill them incurs a breach of covenant, which are nasty for you. You are not required to call a familiar.

<ins>Familiar Services</ins><br>
- Detect Magic (for free, ask nicely).
- Teach you a new spell.
- Grant you one free SD.
- Exercise its unique power.
- Save you from death, once.
- Anything else you can think to ask of it. Just remember that it will count for a favor. 

## Second Sight
You always see invisible things as a faint lensing of light, and can tell roughly how big they are. By making eye contact with someone, you can tell if they are possessed, undead, protected by divinity, or a spell caster.

## Arcane Communion
You can pool your SD with other magic users. Catastrophes affect all of you.

*Rules for creating new spells*

# Spell Words

Between adventures you can spend time and money on research. By spending [treasures](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) you can combine two Spell Words to create a new spell. Spell Words are listed under each spell and more can be obtained during your adventures. You basically deconstruct spells in part to assemble a new one.

For example, if you know the spells *Bloodlust* (Blood + Lust) and *Rockspeech* (Rock + Speech), you can create a new spell named *Bloodspeech* or *Blood to Stone* or *Charm Rock*. As you can see, the words can be replaced by synonyms or expressions with similar meaning. 

Once your new name is chosen, spend a treasure and roll Intelligence. On a success, the spell is created and the Referee will design its effect. You can add 1 on your roll for each previously failed attempt with the same word combo.

Note that you can make a new spell with the same word: *Bloodlust* could become *Charm Blood* or *Bloody Desire* etc.

<summary>DM Notes</summary> 

Familiars usually want to ally themselves with promising young savants with a bright destiny. They want power, indirectly. After bargaining, the hopeful spellcaster makes a intelligence check with the following modifiers.

- Disadvantage if they are boring, meek, or unambitious.
- Advantage if they are power-hungry or promise the familiar great things.
- The character can sacrifice things to appease the familiar. First, they sacrifice as much stuff as they want, then make a wisdom check. Success means that they get a +1 bonus for every treasure and magic item sacrificed this way. Failure means that you have misjudged the familiar’s desires and your sacrifices will count for nothing.

## D8 Familar Goals

1. Exploration of new frontiers (of the mind and/or other planes) and cosmic truth.
1. Iconoclasm and an end to banal religion.

1. Deaths of weaklings and fools.
1. Carnal pleasure, incomprehensible ecstasy.
1. Construction of a vast object, built for some distant, undefined purpose.
1. Destruction of the self through dissolution, dissociative drugs, anomie, and constant exposure to danger.

## D3 Breach of Covenant

1. cursed
1. random mutation
1. permanent -1 to an ability score

## D8 Unique Power

1. Can see the future in spilled intestines, quite accurate.
1. Can teleport the caster (only) to the nearest graveyard.
1. Can double your current HP, but will fade in D20 hours.
1. Can create false gold that will disappear in D20 hours
1. Can create a feast fit for a king
1. Can make a virgin fall in love with you
