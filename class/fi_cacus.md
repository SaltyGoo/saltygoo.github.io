Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to produce enough oil to cover one human-sized creature or object, or a 10' square flat space. This oil is highly slippery, highly flammable, and dries up in 1 hour. If lit, it burns out in 10 minutes, inflicting 1D6 intiatial damage and 1 damage per turn until extiguished.
## Oiled Up I
While you are oiled up, you have advantage when you attempt to seduce or charm.
## Oiled Up II
While you are oiled up, you cannot be grappled.
## Scoundrel
When you succeed in a fighting maneuver, you can plant or steal a small object on your opponent without being notice.
## Oiled Up III
When you are oiled up and an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you can make a fighting maneuver against it.
## Font of Shine
You can use your Body Oil ability twice per day, and it takes 1 action instead of 10 minutes.
## Spitfire
You can create a spark by snapping your fingers. Your oil inflicts 2D6 damage and 2 damage over time when lit.
