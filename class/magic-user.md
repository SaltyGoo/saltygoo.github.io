<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A spellbook, a strange hat.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Magic.

For every Magic User template you have, you gain one extra Spell Dice.

**A:** Identify, School, Spells<br>  
**B:** Call Familiar<br>
**C:** Second Sight<br>
**D:** Arcane Communion<br>

## Identify
By licking an object, you can tell whether or not it is magical.

## School
<ins>Spell List</ins><br>
Every School has a list of spells associated with it. You roll randomly for them each time you take a Magic User template. You must quest to gain other spells.

<ins>Perk/Drawback</ins><br>
Every School give a passive bonus/penalty.

<ins>Cantrips</ins><br>
Every School give minor magical abilities you can use as often as you like.

## Spells
They’re stored in scrolls/books and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.

You start out with two spells. Every time you gain a Magic User template, you gain a new spell, rolled randomly. You can also spend Treasures to copy new spells in your book.

<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Magic User template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to Catastrophe.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

## Call Familiar

You may call to a familiar, a magical spirit. The familiar will appear in 1D20 hours. You must then bargain with it for its service as they like ambition and valuable sacrifices. Roll intelligence with (dis)advantage depending on the bargain; if you fail, no familiar will ever appear for you in this location again, but if it succeeds, the familiar agrees to a mutually binding magical contract. Your familiar will serve you to your last drop of ambition.

Once a familiar has agreed to work with you, it can be summoned to your side. But familiars are fickle. Whenever you attempt to summon your familiar, make a charisma check. Success means that the familiar arrives immediately. Otherwise it arrives in 1D20 hours. If you have annoyed your familiar, you automatically fail this test, while familiars that are extremely pleased will always arrive promptly. 

Familiars can provide a service once per day. For each service, you owe the familiar one favor. They can be pretty nasty tasks, but failing to fulfill them incurs a breach of covenant, which are nasty for you. You are not required to call a familiar.

<ins>Familiar Services</ins><br>
- Detect Magic (for free, ask nicely).
- Teach you a new spell.
- Grant you one free SD.
- Exercise its unique power.
- Save you from death, once.
- Anything else you can think to ask of it. Just remember that it will count for a favor. 

## Second Sight
You always see invisible things as a faint lensing of light, and can tell roughly how big they are. By making eye contact with someone, you can tell if they are possessed, undead, protected by divinity, or a spell caster.

## Arcane Communion
You can pool your SD with other magic users. Catastrophes affect all of you.
