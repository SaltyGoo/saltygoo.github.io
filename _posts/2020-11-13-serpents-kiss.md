D: [dice]*10 minutes

After casting this spell, you grow long, hollow fangs, which may be used for a bite attack as if armed. 

These fangs may also be used to to draw out venom from someone that has been poisoned, negating the poison, though this process is painful and somewhat gruesome. Venom so extracted is then stored in a new gland that develops within the sorcererâ€™s body, and may be delivered later by bite.
