R: 30â€™		D: [dice] hours

You conjure [dice] hovering celestial spirits of radiance that do not shed heat, do not require air, and are not doused by water. The illumination of each is similar to torchlight. 

Gleams may be directed to bedevil enemies, which will cause temporary blindness if a saving throw is failed as long as the spirit remains engaged.
