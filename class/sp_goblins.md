Goblin

For every Goblins template you have, increase your HP by 2.

**A:** Many Goblins<br>
**B:** Goblin Boss<br>
**C:** +1 Goblin Boss<br>
**D:** +1 Goblin Boss, Many Scrappy Things<br>

## Many Goblins
Goblins can see and smell 20' in the dark.

Your HP represents how many goblins are alive. Single target save-or-die effects make you lose 1 HP instead of killing you. The rest affects you normally. If you are reduced to 0 HP, the goblins become strewn about the place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help anyone until healed. 

Because goblins eat trash, you only eat as much rations as one humanoid.

You can carry only as many different objects as your intelligence without losing them. However you can stack items of the same type in stacks as big as your HP. You must have as many of an item as your HP to be able to use them (all your goblins need to be wearing a hammer for you to be able to attack with a hammer).

When performing basic unskilled labour, like digging a trench or carrying buckets, you count as as many people as your HP, but you give up after 1 hour. You can occupy a space as big as 10 square feet.

## Goblin Boss
One goblin in the swarm has earned a name. Once per encounter, for one round, the named goblin can do something different than the other Many Goblins, including using items that not all your goblins have. Give it a name and a short description. 

If you die, each goblin boss survives as a hireling, until you find more goblins and recombine into many goblins.

## Many Scrappy Things
You always have one scrappy [random object](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) accessible that only you can use. However, its different every time you enter a new room, have an encounter, or rest. Its worthless.
