**R**: 60â€™    **D**: 10 minutes 

A prism made of silver glass appears in the air, with 1 HP. It can be struck by non-magical attacks and disappears if hit.

Spells fired at a face on this prism will be split into [dice] copies, each with a different target. Spell cast through the prism generate [dice] additional doom points if they do (see [spellcasting rules)](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).
