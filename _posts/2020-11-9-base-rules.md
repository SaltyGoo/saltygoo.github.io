DnD-adjacent rules inspired by Arnold K's [Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG)](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html) and the general GLOG community on discord.

# **How to Play**

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to **roll** a 20-faced die and add a number from your character sheet to the roll. If the situation is **easy**, the result must be above 10 to succeed, if it's **normal**, you have to beat 15, and if it's **hard**, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on. That's it!

# **Creating a Character**

You have three main stats: **Fortitude**, **Dexterity**, and **Willpower**. Roll 1D6+2 for each. The result is your starting score.

You also have as many **Hit Points** as your **Fortitude** score.

You can have as many things in your **Inventory** as twice your Fortitude score.
You can have as many things in your **Psyche** as twice your Willpower score.

Choose a [**Character Class**](https://saltygoo.github.io/classes/). Add the class’s starting equipment to your Inventory, its skills and spells to your Psyche and the class' _Template A_ abilities to your character sheet.

Voilà!

# Stats & Skills

Your stats and skills cannot be higher than 10.

<ins>**Fortitude**</ins> represents your physical prowess. You roll it for many strength-related feats like lifting boulders, or wrestling an ogre, but also for health related challenges, such as resisting poison, holding your breath and resisting cold weather.

<ins>**Dexterity**</ins> represents your grace, movement, and reflexes. You roll it to climb, jump and run away, to dodge traps and monster attacks, but also to hit with your own weapon attacks.

<ins>**Willpower**</ins> represents the strength of your mind and personality. You roll it to see if people believe your lies or are positively reacting to your presence, but also to resist a spell or emotions such as fear.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Stat</i></summary>
*Beau is running away from a troll. He rolls a D20 and adds his dexterity for a total of 17. This is higher than 15 and means that Beau is out of reach in another location of his choice. However, Gretchen, Beau's ally, rolled 12. That means she hasn't escaped the troll, and both of them will have to keep fighting in the next room in the dungeon.*
</details>

A <ins>**Skill**</ins> can be anything (flower arrangement, swordplay, etc.) and start at a value of 5 . When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skill scores instead of the stats the referee tells you to use if it would thematically make sense. Your skills are stored in your **Psyche**.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example: Using a Skill</summary>
*Beau has 3 points of Willpower and 5 points of a skill named "Swamp Dweller". When trying to seduce the troll, the referee asks him to roll charisma, but Beau argues that his Swamp Dweller skill makes as much sense to use. The referee agrees and Beau adds 5 to his roll instead of 3.*
</details>

***other stats***

<ins>**Hit Points**</ins> (or HP) is the amount of damage you can take before getting [Wounded](#dying--healing).

<ins>**Armor**</ins> is the amount of damage you ignore when an attack hits you. You have 0 armor by default.

# Rolling

When the referee tells you to roll one stat (Strength, when climbing a cliff for example), roll a D20, add your stat, and, if the total is higher than 15, you succeed.

For easy situations, the referee might have you roll higher than 10. For hard situations, 20.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example</summary>
*A troll is roughly as fast as a human. When trying to escape one, Beau had to roll above 15. He rolled 12 and added his movement score of 5, for a total of 17, and thus escaped the troll. He ran into a bunch of slow zombies and didn't want to fight them. It's going to be an easy escape and the referee decides Beau only has to beat 10 to run away.*
</details>

A referee should only call for a roll when both success and failure have interesting consequences. Sometimes, failure only means that it takes 10 minutes to achieve the action instead of a few seconds. Bashing a door, for example, might take moments on a success, and 10 minutes on a failure, attracting monsters to the noise.

Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite. It happens when you have contextual advantages or obstacles (shooting from very far, attacking underwater, etc.).

# Combat

<ins>Turn Order:</ins> You act before the monsters unless they have surprised you.

<ins>Your Turn:</ins> On your turn, your character can move nearby, talk, shout, drop an object or themselves, and do any other one combat action, which can be moving further.

<ins>Attacking:</ins> To attack, roll Strength (or Dexterity for ranged weapons).

If you hit, roll your weapon’s damage and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it.

Rolling 20 on attack means double damage.

<ins>Dodging:</ins> To avoid an attack, roll Dexterity. Rolling 20 means you get a free attack.

# Dying & Healing

Every point of damage you take below 0 HP counts as a Wound. When you gain a wound, you fall unconscious and start dying. If you reach 10 wounds, you die.

When you are dying, you must roll Constitution on each of your turns.
- On a roll of 1, your character dies.
- On a failure, you gain 1 Wound.
- On success, nothing changes.
- On a roll of 20 or on a result of 24 or higher, you stabilize and stop dying.

Up to two allies can roll Wisdom to stabilize you. Expanding bandages gives advantage to that roll. Stabilizing does not remove wounds.

<ins>Healing:</ins> A 8 hours rest heals all HP and stat losses and consumes 1 ration for the team.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care requires you to play another character for 1 session and for the wounded character to spend this time in a safe space with healers.

# Inventory

You have as many inventory slots as twice your strength. Small items like potions and daggers can be stacked in packs of 3. Ammunition, in stacks of 12. Each item above your limit lowers your Movement by 1.

It takes an action to retrieve an item unless it is in your first 3 slots.

In town, you can trade items for other items with the same value: Trash, Mundane, Valuable, and Treasure.

# Leveling Up

In your adventures you will find objects, the most precious of which are Treasures. By spending a Treasure carousing, a character can level up. It gains +2 HP and you can select a new class template (up to 4 total).

Choose a stat, increase it by 1 (up to 10).

After level 4, you get 1 Mastery point instead of any template or bonus.

<ins>Mastery:</ins> You gain a Mastery point when you level up beyond level 4 or bring a skill or a stat to 10. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting a nearby ally at a rate of 1 point for 1 point.
