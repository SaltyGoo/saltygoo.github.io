*Arachnomorphosis*

**D**: 10 minutes

You grow chelicerae, ending in fangs to either side of your mouth, which can be used to deliver venom with a successful attack. Opponents injected with this venom suffer 1D6 poison damage and must save or suffer one of these effects, determined at random (roll a D[dice*2]):

1. Mystic hallucinations
1. Uncontrollable movements
1. [Poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions)
1. Sleep
1. [Poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions)
1. Sudden death in 1D6 rounds
1. [Stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions)
1. Instant death

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
