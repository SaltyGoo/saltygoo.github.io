_You are a psychic tourist visiting this world ..._

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Six porcelain _Body Parts_ (Two arms, two legs, a chest and a head), as well three other objects among the following (you can choose the same one multiple times): a _Lead Mask_ (to protect one ally from your powers), a spare _Body Part_ (specify which), a _Weapon_ of your choice, or a _Sealed Bottle_.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Worlds Beyond Ours, Times Before Ours, or Dreams.

For every Psychonaut template you have, you gain one extra **[Spell Die](/spells)** (SD), gain a new **[Psychomancy Spell](/spells/#psychomancy)**, and your **Vessel**'s damage resistance increases by 1.

**A:** Immaterial Being, Vessel, Psychomancy <br>
**B:** Unbearable Psychic Field <br>
**C:** The Nuanced Art of Elemental Diplomacy <br>
**D:** Salt of the Earth<br>

## Immaterial Being
You do not have a physical body and are thus immune to any damage that is not psychic. First aid and healing magic can't heal you either and your only two senses are sight and hearing. Instead, you contain your consciousness within a **Vessel**.

## Vessel
Your vessel is not immune to damage though: every time you are hit, roll a D6 to know which body part is damaged. When your vessel is damaged, your consciousness starts leaking into the infinite and you lose 1 Hit Point per round. You will keep losing HP until you or someone patches the leak, replaces the broken body part with a hollow object, or you migrate into another sealed container you touch. Your vessel needs joints to allow you to move by yourself. 

**Vessel Body Parts**
1. Head
2. Left Leg
3. Right Leg
4. Left Arm
5. Right Arm
6. Chest

If you take area of effect damage, roll twice for the damaged body parts. If the same body part is rolled twice, it is utterly destroyed.

## Psychomancy
You know the [Astral Projection](/2020/11/13/astral-projection/) spell, as well as a random spell from the [Psychomancy](/spells/#psychomancy) school (roll twice and choose one). You learn a new random psychomancy spell each time you take another Psychonaut template.

## Unbearable Psychic Field
You emit an unbearable low-frequency buzz that inflicts as much damage to _every other_ sentient creature in the same room (or a 30' cube) as you as you have active Spell Dice. You can repress this ability but not if you are leaking.

## Overwhelming Psychic Weight
You can attempt to [grapple](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) *all* other creatures in your psychic field by making one Willpower save. If there are more creatures as you have active SD, the save is _hard_.

## Astranaut
There is no maximum range for travel when you cast [Astral Projection](/2020/11/13/astral-projection/). While astrally projecting, you can move so fast that you can cross a hex in 10 minutes.
