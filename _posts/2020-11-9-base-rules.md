title: Base Rules
---

DnD-adjacent rules inspired by Arnold K's [Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG)](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html) and the general GLOG community on discord, particularly [Locheil](https://nothicseye.blogspot.com/).

<summary><b>How to Play</b></summary>
The referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to **roll** a 20-faced die and add a number from your character sheet to the roll to see if you succeed in your action. If the situation is **easy**, the result must be above 10 to succeed, if it's **normal**, you have to beat 15, and if it's **hard**, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on. 

Sometimes, the referee might tell you that the situation gives you **advantage** or **disadvantage**. Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite.

That's it!

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Creating a Character</b></summary>
You have three main stats: **Fortitude**, **Dexterity**, and **Willpower**. Roll 1D6+2 for each to determine their value.

You also have as many **Hit Points** as your Fortitude score.

You can have as many things in your **Inventory** as twice your Fortitude score. <br>
You can have as many things in your **Psyche** as twice your Willpower score.

Choose a [**Character Class**](https://saltygoo.github.io/classes/). Add the class’s starting equipment to your Inventory, its skills and spells to your Psyche and the class' _Template A_ abilities to your character sheet.

Voilà!

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Stats & Skills</b></summary>

Your stats and skills cannot be higher than 10. If a stat becomes 0, you become paralyzed.

<ins>**Fortitude**</ins> represents your physical prowess. You roll it for strength and endurance-related feats.

<ins>**Dexterity**</ins> represents your grace and reflexes. You roll it for mobility feats like climbing, jumping and running away, and also to dodge attacks and hit things.

<ins>**Willpower**</ins> represents your mind and personality. You roll it for social interactions, but also to resist spells and overwhelming emotions such as fear.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Stat</i></summary>
*Beau is running away from a troll. He rolls a D20 and adds his Dexterity for a total of 17. This is higher than 15 and means that Beau is out of reach in another location of his choice. However, Gretchen, Beau's ally, rolled 12. That means she hasn't escaped the troll, and both of them will have to keep fighting in the next room in the dungeon.*
</details>

A <ins>**Skill**</ins> can be anything (flower arrangement, swordplay, etc.) and starts with a value of 5. When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you to use if it would thematically make sense. Your skills are stored in your **Psyche**.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Skill</i></summary>
*Beau has 3 points of Willpower and 5 points of a skill named "Swamp Dweller". When trying to parley with a troll, the referee asks him to roll Willpower, but Beau argues that his Swamp Dweller skill makes as much sense to use. The referee agrees and Beau adds 5 to his roll instead of 3.*
</details>

<ins>**Hit Points**</ins> (or HP) is the amount of damage you can take before getting Wounded.

<ins>**Armor**</ins> is the amount of damage you ignore when an attack hits you. You have 0 armor by default.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory, Psyche & Beliefs</b></summary>

<ins>**Inventory**</ins>. You have as many slots as twice your Fortitude. Inventory slots can be filled with objects, but also get filled with the Scars and mutations you gain along the way. You gain Scars when you get Wounded and they can only be removed by magic.

Small items like potions and daggers can be stacked in your inventory in packs of 3 of the same type. It takes your turn to retrieve an item during combat unless it is in your first 3 slots.

<ins>**Psyche**</ins>. You have as many slots as twice your Willpower. Psyche slots can be filled with Skills, Spells, Followers and Beliefs, but also with emotional scars you gain along the way. You gain scars when you get Wounded.

You cannot go above your psyche slot limit, but you can always forget a Skill, a Spell, or a Belief, or send a follower back home. You can’t, however, get rid of a scar like that.

You can have as many **Beliefs** as you want, and they can be anything. You can change them and add more each time you level up. At the end of a game session, if you have taken a risk for one of your beliefs, you can increase one of your skills by 1. If a Skill reaches a score of 10 this way, you can remove one emotional scar.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Belief</i></summary>
*Gretchen is fighting a dangerous troll. Her teammate Beau decides to leave his hiding spot to come to her rescue because he believes in selflessness. At the end of the session, he can increase one of his skills by 1 as a reward for having acted upon his Belief.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Armor</b></summary>
Each worn piece of armor reduces damage by 1. <br> 
You can't swim, sneak or jump while wearing 3 or more pieces of armor.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Torches, Ammunitions, & Consumables</b></summary>
Some items like **torches** have a finite use, represented by a D6. After 10 minutes of usage, roll the die. On a result of 1, the item is getting closer to depletion and the D6 becomes a D4. When you roll a 1 on the D4, you only have one use of the item left before it is depleted.

This system can be used for **ammunitions** too, in that case, instead of 10 minutes of usage, you roll after each battle where ammunition was used.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>

<ins>**Turn Order:**</ins> You act before the monsters unless they have surprised you.

<ins>**Your Turn:**</ins> You can move nearby, speak and do one other action, like casting a spell or attacking.

<ins>**Attacking:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the target is easy, normal or hard to hit. Roll Dexterity. If you hit, roll your weapon’s damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it. A die roll of 20 on an attack means double damage.

_On the monsters' turn, they might attack you. In this case, you'll have to dodge._

<ins>**Dodging:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the monster's attack is easy, normal or hard to dodge. Roll Dexterity to avoid it. A die roll of 1 on a dodge means double damage.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Combat</i></summary>
*Gretchen is fighting a dangerous troll. She acts first. On her turn, she yells at her teammate Beau to stop being a coward, swings her sword at the troll, and moves to the edge of a pit, hoping to lure the monster into a precarious position. The referee tells her to make a normal attack roll, so she rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity hoping to get above 15. The result is 18, it's a hit! Her sword inflicts 1D8 points of damage to the troll, who is infuriated.*

*It's the troll's turn! The referee announces that the monster chases her to the edge of the pit and swings its club at her. She must dodge! She rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity. 15! It is not enough to avoid the troll's powerful blow. The referee rolls the monster's damage: 8. Gretchen loses that many Hit Points, bring her to 0. She starts dying.*
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Dying, Wounds & Healing</b></summary>

<ins>**Dying:**</ins> When you reach 0 Hit Points, you start dying. While you are dying, you gain a **Wound** at the end of each of your turns. If you reach 10 Wounds, you die. Each point of damage you take while dying also gives you an extra Wound. 

While dying, you can spend your whole turn to attempt to stabilize. Make a hard Fortitude roll. On a success, you stop dying and have 1 HP. An ally that can reach you with an appropriate Skill or tool can spend their turn making a hard Willpower roll for the same effect. You also stop dying if you recover HP any other way.

Stabilizing does not heal your accumulated Wounds. Instead, you gain a **Scar**. You choose whether the scar will take an Inventory slot or a Psyche slot. As long as you have it, all your rolls against the danger that puts you in that situation easy rolls.

<ins>**Healing:**</ins> A 8 hours rest heals all HP losses and consumes 1 ration for the team.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care happens when you end an adventure in a safe location with healers.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Dying</i></summary>
*Gretchen is dying from a troll attack. On her turn, she calls her ally Beau for help and tries to recover. She rolls 19 on her Fortitude roll. Failure! She gains one Wound.*

*Beau arrives at the scene. He has bandages and could try to stop the bleeding, but the troll is still there and one hit from it could kill Gretchen. He decides to try to push the troll down the nearby pit instead. Success! On her next turn, Gretchen fails her hard Fortitude roll again. She now has 2 wounds. Beau attempts to save her using bandages. He succeeds his hard Willpower roll! Gretchen stops dying, but still has 2 wounds until the end of the adventure.*

*Gretchen has a new Scar. She decides it is going to take an Inventory slot. From now on, she won’t be caught off-guard by a troll. All her rolls against them become easy.*

<summary><b>Treasures</b></summary>

Each object you find has a certain value assigned by the referee:

- trash (worthless)
- mundane (bag of silver coins)
- valuable (bag of gold coins)
- treasure (bag of platinum coins)

A bag of coins takes an Inventory slot. When in town, you can trade items from one category for another in the same category (at the referee's discretion, just say what you are looking for). Alternatively, 4 mundane objects are worth 1 valuable, and 4 valuables are worth 1 treasure.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Carousing!</b></summary>

When you are back to town after an adventure, it is time to spend your loot. Here are a few options:

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Celebrate</ins></summary>
Get drunk and get known! For each Valuable spend in such way, you gain a hangover and a new random [friend](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html) in town. This friend will do favours for you but stay in this town. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your friends becomes a Follower and goes with you in your adventures, acting as a class-less character (until it levels up!). Followers take Psyche slots.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Build a Home</ins></summary>
Spending a Valuable this way will give you 1 piece of mundane furniture. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you also become the owner of a 30' x 30' structure of the shape you want.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Train a Skill</ins></summary>
Spending a Valuable this way will let you increase one of your skills by 1. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you can learn a new skill of your choice instead and put 5 points in it.
</details>

_Some options open up when you have access to specific things:_

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Study a Spellbook</ins></summary>
You need a [Spellbook](/class/wizard#study) and a Treasure worth of materials to study magic. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Craft with Materials</ins></summary>
You need raw materials (like the skin of a monster you’ve slain) to craft and spend as much loot as you want on tools. The object you craft can be anything made mainly with the provided materials. If you used mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spend valuable tools, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Tame a Captured Beast</ins></summary>
You need to have captured a feral [Beast](/list/monsters-beast). You must spend 1 valuable for each of its Hit Dice to make it one of your followers. Each extra valuable spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Contact a Horror from Beyond</ins></summary>
You need to have an eldritch book or a way to contact an [Horror](/list/monsters-aberration). For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) table, choose one of the results and add it to your Inventory. The specific horrors listed on this website have their own mutation tables with extra potential benefits.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Make a Pact with a Celestial Being</ins></summary>
You need to have a holy book or a way to contact a [Divine Creature](/list/monsters-celestial). For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the Celestial Pact table in the divine creature's description, then choose among the quests and rewards your rolled. You become bound to both and lose your soul if you fail the quest.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Build a Construct</ins></summary>
You must have an instruction manual. Each [Construct](/list/monsters-construct) has specific instructions in their description, but it always requires magic and a lot of Treasures. On a success, you gain a very powerful follower. It is expected the party pools their resources together to craft a construct.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Bind an Elemental to You</ins></summary>
You need to have the core of an [Elemental Spirit](/list/monsters-elemental) and spend a Treasure in arcane materials. Roll on the binding table in the elemental's description. You also gain a Spell Dice.
</details>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling Up</b></summary>

You level up when you spend the equivalent of a Treasure in any of the carousing activities mentioned above. When you level up:

- Increase your HP by 2 (up to 20 total).
- Increase one of your stats by 1 (up to 10).
- Gain the next template of your class or take the first template of another class (up to 4 templates total).
