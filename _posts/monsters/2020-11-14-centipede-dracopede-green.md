Armored centipede with an acidic breath attack. A beast.

Imagine a centipede as long as a dog, with brown legs and a moss covered green shell. It eats dead organic matter.

**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile but weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** average, climb average<br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Dracopedes can climb on any surface, including upside down, with little difficulty. They can't see well but detects nearby movement. The green dracopede is well camouflaged in plants and is immune to poison.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (1D4).

<ins>Corrosive Spray (recharge 2/6).</ins> The dracopede spits acid in a short cone. Those who fail their dodge take acid damage (2D4).

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<summary>Credits</summary>
Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. I also love that their breath attacks don't match similarly coloured dragons.
