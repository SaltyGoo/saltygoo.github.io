**R**: Touch		**D**: [sum] hours

You make target creature or object more beautiful. Dirt falls away, pimples disappears, teeth whiten, lice vanish, gouges fill in, and varnish looks new again. For the duration, a creature has advantage on its reaction rolls and and it is easier to bargain with a beautified object. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
