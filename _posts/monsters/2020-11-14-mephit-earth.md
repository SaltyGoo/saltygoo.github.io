title: Mephit, Earth
---

Earth animated by a spark of mischief. Elemental earth.

Imagine if a little grotesque gargoyle was made of dirt and gravel.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** sturdy yet dumb <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As elemental earth, the earth mephit *resists all damage*. It *recovers 1 HP* every round spent on the ground and *loses 1 HP* each round spent not touching it. It has the same properties as gravel.

Additionally, when the earth mephit dies, it explodes in a small burst of gravel inflicting 1D4 damage to all adjacent creatures and objects.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Spit Gravel</ins>. The mephit makes a short-ranged attack against two adjacent targets (1).

<ins>Claw</ins>. The mephit makes a melee attack (1).

<ins>Enlarge</ins> (recharge 2/6). The mephit becomes as big as a human for 10 minutes. Its damage dices increase by 1 size and it gains 1D8 temporary HP.
