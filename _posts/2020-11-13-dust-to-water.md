title: Dust to Water
---

R: 30'

You petition water to take over earth. [dice*5'] cube of dust, sand or loose earth is transformed into clean water. Alternatively all the dusty surfaces in a [dice*15'] cube become clean and wet. When you cast this spell, you can sacrifice 1 ration as an offering to Water and affect stone instead of dust, or 1 treasure to transform metal. Creating elemental unbalance as such is dangerous, and if you do so, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 doom point.
