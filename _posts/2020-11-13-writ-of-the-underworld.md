R: 30’		D: [dice]*10 minutes

You invoke one of the ancient pacts and writs enforced by the old gods on their subjects. There are many, and you must choose their utterance to victimize aberrations, celestials, elementals, feys or undead beings in the are. While the spell lasts, whenever a victim’s HP is equal or less than [sum], it is forced to flee the area. 

If the [sum] is more than twice the maximum HP of the victim, you can decide whether they are utterly destroyed or bound to perpetually and faithfully serve you, even should they leave the area.

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent in the room or area.
