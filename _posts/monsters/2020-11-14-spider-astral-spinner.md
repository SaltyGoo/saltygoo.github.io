title: Spider, Astral Spinner
---

Parasitic spiders dwelling in the astral plane but preying on the material. A beast.

Imagine a foot-long hairless spider the color of polished silver. Its hollow abdomen holds an eye-sized gelatinous orb filled with red, blue or purple liquid.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** average, climb average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Spiders can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, with little difficulty. They are connected to their web and can feel anything that touches it. The astral spinner's web is made of pure silver coated in sticky fluid and exists both in the astral and material world. A body part wrapped in it cease to exist in the material world.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bind.</ins> The astral spinner goads a creature into tangling itself even more in its web. On a failed save, roll a new grappled body part. If 3 or more body parts are grappled, 1D4 more astral spinners phase in. If the whole body is bound, the creature is fully phased to the astral plane and will be devoured by the Astral Spinner Host.

<ins>Phase.</ins> The astral spinner switches between the astral plane and the material plane.

# Astral Spinner Host

Imagine an emaciated humanoid with mandilbles, very long fingers and eyes like beads filled with blue, red or purple liquid. It floats in the middle of its silver hair that spreads 300' across like spiderwebs. 

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium (gargantuan with hair) <br>
**Stats:** slow and feral<br>
**Movement:** fly slow <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

The spinner host is entirely in the astral sea. Unlike the spinners themselves, it cannot see and phase to the material world. It is surrounded by 300' of sticky silver hairs that capture whoever tries to get close to it. If the web is disturbed, 1D4 astral spinners appear.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Latch.</ins> The astral spinner host makes a melee attack (1D4) and grapple a target with its mandibles.

<ins>Drain Essence.</ins> The astral spinner host drains a grappled target of its essence, inflicting 1D4 CHA damage. If this brings the target's CHA to 0, to is phased back to the material world as a dead, empty husk.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

The astral spinner might be dangerous, but is highly saught after: First, its silk is really pure silver. Once washed of the sticcky goo, it can be melted to maked the highest quality metal. Rumor even has it that it can be forged into weapons capable of cutting silver cords. Secondly, the gelatinous orb in its abdomen can be popped out and eaten (it tastes like gummybear. These orbs are actually the host's eyes, which regrow after being ripped out by the astral spinner babies it vomits.

<span class="alchemy">**Astral Spinner Eye**. When eaten, causes to astrally project for 1D4 hours. Roll 1D12, on a roll of 1, you dont come back and transform into an astral spinner host. </span>
