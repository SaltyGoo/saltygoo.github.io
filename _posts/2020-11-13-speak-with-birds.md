D: Sigil 

You draw your Sigil on a creature’s forehead. As long as the Sigil is not erased (by a bath or rain), the sigiled creature can talk to birds and they can talk back. If there is a humanoid moving nearby, there’s a [sum]x10% chance that a random songbird in the area knows where they are and if they’re doing anything extra weird. Most birds are neurotic but easily bribed.
