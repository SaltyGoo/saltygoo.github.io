<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some [humanoids](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-humanoid) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Bold abilities are passive, underlined ones are added to the attack options of the original creature. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Cultists worship powerful creatures such as demons, feys and aberrations. Warlocks, witches, heretics and animists are common types of cultists. They have weird magical powers that mimic their object of worship as opposed to spells.
