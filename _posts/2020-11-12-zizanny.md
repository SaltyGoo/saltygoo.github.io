**R**: 30â€™        **D**: [dice] minutes

Every word and tone around you becomes twisted. [dice] targets must save or perceive all writing or all conversation as saying the opposite of what is intended.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effects affect an area permanently. All words said or written in it are misunderstood without save.
