DnD-adjacent rules inspired by Arnold K's [Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG)](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html) and the general GLOG community on discord, particularly [Locheil](https://nothicseye.blogspot.com/).

<summary><b>How to Play</b></summary>
The **referee** describes a situation and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a d20-faced die and add a number from your character sheet to see if your character succeeds in its action. If the situation is **easy**, the result must beat 10 to succeed, if it’s **normal**, it has to beat 15, and if it’s **hard**, 20. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.
  
Sometimes, the referee might tell you that the situation gives you **advantage** or **disadvantage.** Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite.

That's it!
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Creating a Character</b></summary>

You have three main stats: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, and **Willpower**. Roll 1D6 + 2 for each to determine their value. Strength will determine your endurance and how much you can carry, dexterity will determine your prowess in combat, and willpower will determine you resistance to advercity and how many powers you can have.

You also have as many **Hit Points (HP)** as your Strength score.

You have an **Inventory** as big as twice your Strength score and a **Psyche** as big as twice your Willpower score.

Choose a [**Character Class**](https://saltygoo.github.io/classes/). Add the class’s starting equipment to your Inventory, and its skills and spells to your Psyche. Each class level takes a Psyche slot. Note its abilities.

Give your character 1 or 2 Beliefs, which you add to their Psyche. Beliefs are anything worth dying for.

Voilà!
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Skills & Beliefs</b></summary>

A <ins>**Skill**</ins> can be any knowledge, and is stored is your Psyche. When asked to roll for an action, if it would thematically make sense to benefit from one of your skills, the roll becomes easier (a hard roll becomes a normal roll, a normal roll becomes an easy roll, and an easy roll becomes a success).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Skill</i></summary>
*Beau has a skill named "Swamp Dweller". When trying to parley with a troll, the referee asks him to make a hard Willpower roll, but Beau argues that his Swamp Dweller skill would make him more relatable for the monster. The referee agrees and Beau only needs to beat 15 on his roll instead of 20.*
</details>

A <ins>**Belief**</ins> can be anything worth dying for, and is stored in your Psyche. If you take a deadly risk for your belief during your adventures, you are be reward when _Carousing_.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Using a Belief</i></summary>
*Gretchen is fighting a dangerous troll. Her teammate Beau decides to leave his hiding spot to come to her rescue because he believes in selflessness. At the end of the adventure, Beau can remove a trauma from his psyche, or gain a new follower impressed by his beliefs.*
</details>

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Inventory & Psyche</b></summary>

<ins>**Inventory**</ins>. You have as many slots as twice your Strength. Inventory slots can be filled with objects. Small items like potions, daggers, and ammunition can be stacked in your inventory in packs of 10 of the same type. If you go beyond your capacity, you become _Prone_.

<ins>**Psyche**</ins>.You have as many slots as twice your Willpower. Psyche slots can be filled with Skills, Class Levels, Spells, Followers and Beliefs. If you go beyond your capacity, you become _Dazed_. You can only remove things from your Psyche when _Carousing_.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Combat</b></summary>

<ins>**Turn Order:**</ins> You act before the monsters unless they have surprised you.

<ins>**Your Turn:**</ins> You can move nearby, speak and do one other action, like casting a spell or attacking.

<ins>**Attacking:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the target is easy, normal or hard to hit. Roll Dexterity. If you hit, roll your weapon’s damage die and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it. A die roll of 20 on an attack means double damage.

_On the monsters' turn, they might attack you. In this case, you'll have to dodge._

<ins>**Dodging:**</ins> The referee will tell you if the monster's attack is easy, normal or hard to dodge. Roll Dexterity to avoid it. A die roll of 1 on a dodge means double damage.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Combat</i></summary>
*Gretchen is fighting a dangerous troll. She acts first. On her turn, she yells at her teammate Beau to stop being a coward, swings her sword at the troll, and moves to the edge of a pit, hoping to lure the monster into a precarious position. The referee tells her to make a normal attack roll, so she rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity hoping to get above 15. The result is 18, it's a hit! Her sword inflicts 1D8 points of damage to the troll, who is infuriated.*

*It's the troll's turn! The referee announces that the monster chases her to the edge of the pit and swings its club at her. She must dodge! She rolls a D20 and adds her Dexterity. 15! It is not enough to avoid the troll's powerful blow. The referee rolls the monster's damage: 8. Gretchen loses that many Hit Points, bring her to 0. She starts dying.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Dying, Scars, Trauma & Healing</b></summary>

<ins>**Dying:**</ins> When you reach 0 Hit Points, you fall prone and you start dying. If you take damage while dying, you die. If you recover any hit point while dying you stop dying.

On each of your next 3 turns, you can attempt to **Stabilize** instead of doing anything else. Make a hard Strength roll. On a success, recover 1 HP. An ally can spend their turn making a hard Willpower roll for the same effect if they can reach you with appropriate tools or skills. After 3 turns, if you are still dying, you **die**.

If you recover from dying, you gain a **Scar**. If you die, all your companions gain a **Trauma**.

<ins>**Scars:**</ins> Scars take inventory slots and cannot be removed. Note what caused the scar. As long as you have it, you have advantage against that thing.

<ins>**Traumas:**</ins> Traumas take psyche slots and can only be removed through risking your own life for one of your beliefs. Note what caused the trauma. As long as you have it, you have disadvantage against that thing.

_If you ever mutate, it takes an inventory slot. If you are ever cursed, it takes a psyche slot. Either can only be removed through magic._

<ins>**Healing:**</ins> A 8 hours rest heals all HP losses and consumes 1 ration for the team. Resting requires shelter and heat.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><i>Example: Dying</i></summary>
*Gretchen is dying from a troll attack. On her turn, she calls her ally Beau for help and tries to recover. She rolls 19 on her Strength roll. Failure! She is two turns away from death.*

*Beau arrives at the scene. He has bandages and could try to stop the bleeding, but the troll is still there and one hit from it could kill Gretchen. He decides to try to push the troll down the nearby pit instead. Success! On her next turn, Gretchen fails her hard Strength roll again. She is now one turn away from death! Beau attempts to save her using bandages. He succeeds his hard Willpower roll! Gretchen stops dying, and gains a scar which takes an invetory slot. From now on, she won’t be caught off-guard by a troll. All her rolls against them have advantage.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Exploring</b></summary>

Time is tracked differently when you travel outdoors or in a dungeon. **Dungeons** are divided in rooms. Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action like investigating a room or battling takes 10 minutes. You roll to see if your torches deplete every 10 minutes and the referee rolls for random encounters every 30 minutes. You can cross 10 safe rooms you have explored per 10 minutes, or 3 if you want to be discreet.

The **world outside** of a dungeon is divided in hexagons. Any worthwhile action like crossing or exploring a hex lasts 6h of the day (*Morning, Day, Evening, or Night*). The referee rolls for encounters each time you enter a new location, explore a location or rest.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Treasures</b></summary>

Each object you find has a certain value assigned by the referee:

- mundane (bag of copper coins)
- useful (bag of silver coins)
- valuable (bag of gold coins)
- treasure (bag of gems)

A bag of coins takes an Inventory slot. When in town, you can trade items from one category for another in the same category (at the referee’s discretion, just say what you are looking for). Alternatively, 4 mundane objects are worth 1 useful object, 4 useful objects are worth 1 valuable, and 4 valuables are worth 1 treasure.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leveling Up</b></summary>

You level up when you spend the equivalent of a Treasure Carousing. When you level up:

- Increase your HP by 2 (up to 20 total).
- Increase one of your stats by 1 (up to 10).
- Gain the next level of your class in alphabetical order or take the first level (A) of another class (up to 4 templates total).

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Carousing!</b></summary>

When you are back to town, it is time to spend your loot! Choose one of these activities :

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Celebrate and Gain Followers</ins></summary>
Get drunk and get known! For each Valuable spent in such way, you gain a hangover and a new random [friend](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html) in town. This friend will do favours for you but stay in this town. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, one of your friends becomes a **Follower** and goes with you in your adventures, acting as a class-less character (until it levels up!). Followers take Psyche slots.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Craft</ins></summary>
You need raw materials (like the skin of a monster you’ve slain) to craft and spend as much loot as you want on tools. The object you craft can be anything made mainly with the provided materials. If you used mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spend valuable tools, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Build a Home</ins></summary>
Spending a Valuable this way will give you 1 piece of mundane furniture. If you end up spending the equivalent of a Treasure, you also become the owner of a 30' x 30' structure of the shape you want.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Study a Spellbook</ins></summary>
You need a [Spellbook](/class/wizard#study) and a Treasure worth of arcane materials to study magic. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Tame a Captured Beast</ins></summary>
You need to have captured a feral [Beast](/list/monsters-beast). You must spend 1 valuable for each of its Hit Dice to make it one of your followers. Each extra valuable spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Contact a Horror from Beyond</ins></summary>
You need to have an eldritch book or a way to contact an [Horror](/list/monsters-aberration). For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) table, choose one of the results and add it to your Inventory. The specific horrors listed on this website have their own mutation tables with extra potential benefits.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Make a Pact with a Celestial Being</ins></summary>
You need to have a holy book or a way to contact a [Divine Creature](/list/monsters-celestial). For each Valuable spent in this ritual, roll on the Celestial Pact table in the divine creature's description, then choose among the quests and rewards your rolled. You become bound to both and lose your soul if you fail the quest.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Build a Construct</ins></summary>
You must have an instruction manual. Each [Construct](/list/monsters-construct) has specific instructions in their description, but it always requires magic and a lot of Treasures. On a success, you gain a very powerful follower. It is expected the party pools their resources together to craft a construct.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><ins>Bind an Elemental to You</ins></summary>
You need to have the core of an [Elemental Spirit](/list/monsters-elemental) and spend a Treasure in arcane materials. Roll on the binding table in the elemental's description. You also gain a Spell Dice.
</details>

In any case, if you have taken a deadly risk for one of your beliefs, you can either remove one of your Traumas, gain a new Skill related to your risky action or obtain a new Follower.

</details>

---

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Followers</b></summary>

You gain followers by Carousing and they take a Psyche slot. Roll 1D6 for each of their stats. Followers can carry 3 objects and have 2 Hit Points. They can gain a class the same way a character levels up. In which case they gain +2 to all stats, and normal HP and inventory.

</details>

---

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Spellcasting</b></summary>
Some classes can cast spells. They have Spell Dice (SD).

<ins>Casting a Spell</ins><br>
Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). Triples give 3 Points, and Quadruples, 6 points. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

<ins>Sigil</ins><br>
Some spells mention a Sigil. It's your unique symbol. A spell cast with a Sigil takes 10 minutes to cast, but lasts forever. You can have as many Sigils up as your level.
