<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
*This was initially a monster class for the [Cacus](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/cacus). In greco-roman mythology, Cacus was a cattle-stealing, fire-breathing giant who fought Hercules. Expending on the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) adaptation of this myth into a DnD monster, I wanted to play on the trope of the handsome ancient greek shepherd who is also an olympian, and make it an asshole jock type of monster. â€” SaltyGoo*

**B:** Oiled Up II, Scoundrel<br>
**C:** Oiled Up III<br>
**D:** Font of Shine, Spitfire<br>

## Body Oil
Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to produce enough oil to cover one human-sized creature or object, or a 10' square flat space. This oil is highly slippery, highly flammable and dries up in 1 hour. It smells like you.
## Oiled Up I
While you are oiled up, you have advantage on your attempts to seduce or charm.
## Oiled Up II
While you are oiled up, you cannot be grappled.
## Scoundrel
When you succeed on a fighting maneuvre, you can plant or steal a small object on your opponent.
## Oiled Up III
When you are oiled up and an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you can make a fighting maneuvre against it.
## Font of Shine
You can use your Body Oil ability twice per day.
## Spitfire
You can create a spark by snapping your fingers. Instead of using your Body Oil ability, you can spit a cone of fire and ignite 2 adjacent nearby targets. The cone inflicts 2D6 fire damage, halved on a save. Targets who fail their save continue taking 1 damage every round until they extinguish the flames.
