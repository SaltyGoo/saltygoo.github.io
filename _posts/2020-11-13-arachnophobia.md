**R**: Sight  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

_All iterations of [animal] should be replaced by a specific animal species when the spell is first found._

[sum] creatures become [frightened](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) of [animal] and [animal]-like things.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and target only one creature, the effect becomes permanent.

###### [animal] + fear
