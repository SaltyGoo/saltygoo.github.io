###### By SaltyGoo. This is a monster class for the [Athach](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/athach). A monster class must be the first class you take. Ask your referee if the monster exists in their world, or you could just have met one in one of your previous adventures.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Iron pacifier, pelt blanket, giant rattle (hammer). 

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Screaming, your starting weapon.

For every Three-Armed Giant Baby template you have, increase your HP by 2.

**A:** Three-Armed, Giant Baby<br>
**B:** Awaken the Laylines<br>
**C:** Feel the Laylines<br>
**D:** Feed the Laylines<br>

## Three-Armed
You have three arms. Doing different things at the same time with each is clumsy.

## Giant Baby
You are affraid of creatures bigger than you. Save when you see one. 

## Awaken the Laylines
As a baby primeval giant, you are starting to attune to the power that flows through the land. Any room or area you cross has 1/6 chance of being crossed by a layline of power (note them!). The zone must be on the ground floor or below. While you are on a layline, the following effects affect everybody:

- All [Spell Dices](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells) are recovered on a roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Plants grow twice as fast and big (affects spells too).
- All death rolls are made with advantage.

## Feel the Laylines
While on a layline, you can spend 10 minutes to know if a layline continues in one direction of your choice. There's 1/6 chance it does. If it does and there is a room in that direction, the referee tells you if there are monsters there and if they are magical. 

During Hexcrawl you have advantage on encounters.

## Feed the Laylines
If you plant one seed, vegetable or fruit on a layline and come back to it after a long rest, roll 1D6:

1. The plant has fully grown.
1. The plant has fully grown and bears Cold Iron fruits.
1. The area collapsed
1. 2 HD of local beasts were attracted to the location, you can give them a 2 word command.
1. A swarm of local vermin were attracted to the location, you can give it a 2 word command.
1. You have awakened a local elemental, you can give a 2 word command to the area itself.
