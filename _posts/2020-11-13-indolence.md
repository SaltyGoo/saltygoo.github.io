**R**: Sightâ€ƒ		**D**: [dice] rounds

All within a 30' melee area are stricken with lethargy, moving hitting, dodging and outrunning them becomes easy. Creatures of [dice] HD or less are affected automatically, while others are permitted a saving throw to avoid the effect. 

Indolence may also be cast on mechanisms or other things that engage in progress or change.
