<span class="alchemy">**Hag Warts.** Ingredient. If you make a broth with _hag warts_ and the _blood_ of 4 different types of nocturnal creatures, you can permanently change one word from one of your class abilities or known spell to "_Cauldron_". If mixed with another potion or recipe, change one word of its effect with "_Ugly_".</span>
