R: 30'

You create a 10-foot cube of stone per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. If it is horizontal, the wall must be anchored on at least 2 sides. The stone is brittle and flaky. If used in territory controlled by a faction, it may be considered an act of war or a prelude to an invasion.
