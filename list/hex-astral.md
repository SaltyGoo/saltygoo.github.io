Each time your roll on the astral hex table, you fill 5 hexes on the map with colorful astral void. Roll 1D8:

| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 1. Red  |  5. Blue  |
| 2. Pink  |  6. Violet  |
| 3. Yellow &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |  7. Black  |
| 4. Green  |  8. White  |

1D4 of them are empty. The rest is occupied by the feature you rolled. To get your feature, roll twice on the table below: once for the adjective, once for the feature. Note the two hasards and creatures that inhabit your area.
