title: Wall of Ice

**R**: 30'

You create 10-foot cube of ice per [dice]. You can mold the wall, similar to cutting holes and notches in a sheet of paper. If it is horizontal, the wall must be anchored on at least 2 sides and is slippery. If the temperature is above 0, the wall will become fragile after 10 minutes, and completely melt in 1 hour. A creature trapped by the wall will take 1D6 cold damage every 10 minutes.
