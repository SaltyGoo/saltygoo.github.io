**R**: 60’		**D**: 1 hour

You imbue a living flower or fungi with your strong psychic imagery and it blossoms, spreading its spore within [dice]*10’. Any creature entering the zone and failing a saving throw will hallucinate a predetermined 10 minute scene, which cannot extend beyond the spores.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
