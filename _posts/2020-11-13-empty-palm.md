**R**: 30'    **D**: [dice] rounds

You fire a gigantic hand (about the size of a pony) made of blue life-force from your own hand.  The hand can be used to strike anyone within range for 1D8+[dice] damage, or it can do anything else a giant hand could do.  It cannot move further than 30' from you, but it can hold things or lift things up. It has a STR and a HP of [sum].

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the duration lasts until you rest.
