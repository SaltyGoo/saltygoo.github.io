Brain-eating, thrall-making flying octopuses. An aberration.

Imagine a flying octopus, with a bulging, pulsing brain and two very human looking eyes.

It seeks different able bodies to use as disposable labor to build their empire. Multiple digits are highly valuable. <br>

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** odd <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly average, swim average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As an aberration, the Abysmal *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally the brain-bat can breathe underwater and see in the dark.

The brain bat can also talk telepathically, but only knows its own language and the ones known by the body it is controlling. Due to its partial understanding of personality, its face always reveals its true intentions.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Drill Brain.</ins> The brain-bat attaches itself to an adjacent target. If the target fails a saving throw, it takes intelligence damage (1D4). At 0 intelligence, the target becomes a zombie enslaved to the attached brain-bat, who also gains its knowledge. An attached creature takes half the damage the brain-bat takes.

The brain-bat can take control of dead bodies in the same way.

The brain-bats is a monster that [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) adapted in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) from a 50s comic book, "The brain-bats from Venus". It's camp, it's scary and fun to play with. — SaltyGoo
