<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Blue Gnome Crags</span>

The foothills are split here in two 200 ft high cliffs. It is well known that the xvarts' village is somewhere hidden here but you cant help to notice movement coming from the many cornices and nooks of the valley.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Xvart Village</span>

Sheltered by the area's crags, the xvarts' village is an impressive collection of cliffside huts and caves linked by rope bridge. Invading it wis not an easy task.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Ursa's Cave</span>

The Xvarts have relied on this local dire bear to deter wanderers from coming too close to their home. Its den is a by mountainside cave with a comfortable carpet of dried pine needles and the remnants of many offerings.
