**R**: Touch		**D**: 10 minutes

You touch a target and, for the duration of the spell, you roll saves in its stead, adding a +[dice] bonus to the rolls. If you fail, the target cannot be saved and is [cursed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for the rest of the day.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell and scribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the target, the effects become permanent.
