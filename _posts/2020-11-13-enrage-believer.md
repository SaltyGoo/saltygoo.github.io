**R**: Voice	**D**: [sum] Rounds

You cause an honest believer to hear anything you say as a blasphemy against their god, making them fly into rage that gives them disadvantage to hit and advantage to damage, also forcing them to attack you in whatever way they can. If you cast this spell with three or more dice, you may decide that it targets all believers who hear it.
