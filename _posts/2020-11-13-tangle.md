title: Tangle
---
**R**: Touch		**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

A tangle of ropes can be put in a location, and they will impede the passage of any creature up to the size of an elephant, halving the maximum speed of any trespasser and making charges and spell casting impossible.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent in this location.
