**R**: Touch  **D**: Until Morning

A fully furnished gingerbread house of up to [dice]*100 Square Feet is constructed over the course of the next 10 minutes by Elves (the chill kind, not those other bastards). Obviously not effective for rain, but very good for winds and snows. Also counts as [dice] rations! Can't be constructed to overlap with things too big for it to contain (e.g. pillars or trees). Also, the elves can be rather skittish, and will stop building the house if they percieve danger. They'll resume work when danger is gone. If [sum] is more than 12, it is permanent (though not imperishable).
