**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You place your Sigil on [sum] stones, then cooks them well in abundant milk. They can each be used once to either heal a creature 1 point of damage or flung as a magic sling stone with a + [dice] bonus to hit. 

As an alternative you can carefully keep on cooking the milk with the stones for a day to produce a brew that grants an advantage on a save against disease or curse for 24 hours.
