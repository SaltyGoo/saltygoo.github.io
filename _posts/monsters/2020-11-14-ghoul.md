Cannibalistic people with rabies. An humanoid undead.

Imagine a humanoid with sickly skin, bare feet crusted with dirt, hands black with blood, and a long, thick tongue that stretches all the way to its navel. Its eyes are bloodshot and evil and its long, dirty nails are hardened like claws.

Drool, blood and rotten meat chunks stain this creatureâ€™s blackened lips, gum and chest. It stinks.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none<br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** agile, semi-feral<br> 
**Movement:** normal, climb normal <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As undead creatures, ghouls do not starve to death (even if they do feel hunger), breathe, sleep or tire and cant be poisoned.

Ghouls are more clever than most people think. When they are not consumed by hunger for flesh, which is very rare, they are as eloquent as they were alive. They use their good stealth and climbing speed to ambush their preys from surprising locations.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Diseased Claw</ins>.  The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D4). On a hit, the target must save vs diseases or be paralyzed. A paralyzed target can save again at the end of each of its turns, getting free after two successes, or after 10 minutes if it fails two times, whichever comes first. If the target fails, it catches ghoul rabies.

<ins>Feral Bite</ins>. The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D6). Other creatures have advantage on their melee attacks against it until its next turn.

<ins>Rush.</ins> The ghoul attempts to shove a target. On its next turn, it will act first.

<span class="alchemy">
**Ghoul Rabies**. Disease. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: requires to eat 1 extra ration per day. While sick, you can only eat meat. If you die sick, you become a ghoul.
