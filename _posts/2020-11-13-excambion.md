**R**: 60' **D**: [dice] hours

You switch the properties of two inanimate objects in range. Each object have the four following Properties, as defined by the referee which are easily visible to you when casting the spell :

- **Purpose** - what is the object meant to do? An axe cleaves, a shovel digs.
- **Material** - what is the object made of, truly? Not necessarily the majority composition, but the most fundamental composition - an axe may have more handle than head, but to the eyes of the Attainder it is made of steel.
- **Scale** - how large is the object, roughly? 
- **Blessedness** - is the object worked by magic? Accursed? 

You may select up to [dice] properties, and swap them between the objects targeted - give a house the Purpose of a sword to turn it into a death trap, and the sword into a birdhouse.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the objects, the effect becomes permanent.
