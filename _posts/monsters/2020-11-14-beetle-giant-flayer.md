title: Beetle, Giant Flayer

Brain sucking giant flea. A small beast.

_Imagine a cat-sized flea with a green iridescent exoskeleton. A long probe coils from its mouth. An opportunistic predator._

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Giant flayer shell can be used for armor but has 1-6 chance to break on each hit. A more common use would be to ground it to make a green iridescent dye.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The giant flayer beetle is an original creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/08/new-oebx1e-monster-giant-flayer-beetle.html). When adapting it to the GLoG, I made it slightly less sturdy but a bit more reliable: the original was only threatening when rolling a critical hit, this one does intelligence damage more often. — SaltyGoo
