## Post Game Character Growth

###### Inspired by Arnold K's [Legendarium](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-legendarium-diagetic-advancement.html)

<ins>Heroism.</ins> After a session, note one heroic thing you did. You can add 1 to a Skill that directly relates to this gesture. You can only know as many skills as your Intelligence. You can replace old skills as you get new ones.

<ins>Scars.</ins> Also, after a session, if you got wounded, you now have a scar. This scar makes you resistant to the specific danger that gave you the Wound (as defined by the referee). You can only have as many scars as your Constitution.  You can replace old scars as you get new ones. If you somewhat mutate during you adventure, each mutation takes the place of a scar but cannot be removed.

## Damage Types

If you want to do more with the elements, you can remove a damage dice from your attack to have a powerful on-hit effect instead:
- <ins>Acid:</ins> negate armor for a round.
- <ins>Cold:</ins> prevent movement for a round.
- <ins>Electric:</ins> attack nearby target for 1 dice.
- <ins>Fire:</ins> destroy a flammable small object.
- <ins>Mind:</ins> charm for a round.
- <ins>Magical:</ins> ignore resistance.
- <ins>Poison:</ins> poison for a round.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example</summary>
*Margh the Vile casts a spell inflicting 2D6 electric damage to a goblin. She can choose to inflict 1D6 damage instead and attack another nearby goblin for 1D6 damage. Boo Son of Jean has a sword of frost inflicting 1D8 damage, but he wants to capture the enemy alive. Instead, he sacrifes the D8. On a hit, he inflicts 0 damage and the monster's feet are frozen to the ground for a round.*

## Stat Damage

Various monsters and spells can damage your stats instead of your HP. Here is what happens when one of your stats reaches 0:

<ins>Strength:</ins> you are Stunned, yet can talk.<br>
<ins>Dexterity:</ins> you are Prone and cant stand.<br>
<ins>Constitution:</ins> you are Dying.<br>
<ins>Intelligence:</ins> you are Dazed and mute.<br>
<ins>Wisdom:</ins>the referee takes over<br>
<ins>Charisma:</ins> you are forgotten. Nobody, even friends, can help you in any way.

---

## Conditions

<ins>Blinded:</ins> You cant see or make ranged attacks. You need to roll above 20 to hit with a melee attack, enemies need to roll above 10 to hit you.

<ins>(Not) Breathing:</ins> You can hold your breath for as many rounds as your CON. If you take damage while holding your breath, you must make a CON save. On a failure, you start dying.

<ins>Charmed:</ins> You fail all rolls against your charmer. If you attack, hurt, or say anything bad about them, you take 1 mind damage. 

<ins>Confused:</ins> Roll a D6. You must spend your turn interacting with: 1) the player on your right; 2) the player on your left; 3) yourself; 4) the closest monster; 5) the environment; 6) oblivion.

<ins>Cursed:</ins> You cannot benefit from any magic.

<ins>Dazed:</ins> You can act OR move on your turn.  

<ins>Deafened:</ins> You cant hear. Your teammates cannot talk to you or about you.

<ins>Dying:</ins> See [Dying & Healing](/2020/11/09/base-rules#dying--healing).

<ins>Fatigued:</ins> -1 to all stats. Cumulative.

<ins>Frightened:</ins> You cannot interact with the source of your fear until you have spent a full turn without seeing it. Roll a D6: 1) drop whatever you are holding; 2) scream; 3) fall prone; 4) grapple closest ally or object; 5) you are stunned for one turn; 6) run away.

<ins>Grappled:</ins> Cannot move. Roll a D6: 1) your head/mouth/throat is stuck, you cant breathe; 2) left leg; 3) right leg; 4) left arm; 5) right arm; 6) an item you wear or hold is stuck.

<ins>Invisible:</ins> Others need to roll above 20 to hit you, you need to roll above 10 to hit them.

<ins>Petrified:</ins> You are stunned. You resist the first 10 damage of each attack.

<ins>Poisoned:</ins> You are disadvantaged in all your actions. Specific poisons have unique additional effects too (ask the referee).

<ins>Prone:</ins> Others only need to roll above 10 to hit you in melee, but above 20 to hit you from range. You need above 20 to hit in melee. Your speed stat is reduced to 0. Standing up takes all your movement for the turn.

<ins>Stunned:</ins> You skip your turn and you fail all saves. Attacks hit you on a 10 or higher.

## Rare Metals

Fairies, elementals, ghosts and devils resist or ignore damage. But some rare metals overcome that. Additionaly, Adamantium and Platinum weapons are very useful for fighters because they dont get destroyed when they use their [parry](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/fighter#parry) ability.

<ins>Adamantium:</ins> Nothing is more solid than adamantium. You can forgo a damage dice when inflicting damage with it to destroy an object. An adamantium object is unbreakable.

<ins>Cold Iron:</ins> A faerie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

<ins>Silver:</ins> Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and of creatures that are not in their true form.

<ins>Mithral:</ins> Is light like cloth. Weapons made of mithral can be used with Dexterity. Armors made of mithral do not penalize Dexterity.

<ins>Radium:</ins> Radium sheds light like a candle and inflicts 1D4 extra poison damage. It ignore the resistances of celestial creatures like angels and devils. After each adventure spent carrying radium, save or gain a [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html).

<ins>Platinum:</ins> Platinum repairs itself in 1 hour. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrations as well as their horrid immortality.

## Traveling

Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action takes 10 minutes. The referee rolls for random encounters every 30 minutes and asks the players to choose odd or even, if they lose, one torch or lantern is depleted.

On the world map, any worthwhile action like crossing a hex or exploring an hex takes a 4h block (*Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Dusk, Evening, Night*). Roll for encounters for each location change. Environmental penalties can happen.

---

## Treasures

Each object you find has a certain value:

- trash (worthless)
- mundane (bag of silver coins)
- valuable (bag of gold coins)
- treasure (chest of gold coins)

When in town, you can trade items from one category for another in the same category (at the referee's discression, just say what you are looking for). Alternatively, 4 mundane objects are worth 1 valuable, and 4 valuables are worth 1 treasure.

## Between Adventures

Leveling up is just one way of gaining new powers. This is where you can convert treasures in character levels. If one of the following options allow you to roll on a table, you can roll once per treasure spent and choose the outcome you prefer.

Spend a Treasure to **carouse**! <br>
You will attract new (non-combatant) [followers](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html "Coins and Scrolls"), but there is a risk you end up partying a [bit too hard](https://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html "Jeff's Gameblog") if you fail a constitution roll. **You level up!**

Spend a Treasure to **build a base**!<br>
1 Treasure can build a basic 30'30' room, and one Valuable can be traded for 1 piece of standard furniture.

Spend a Treasure to **learn new skills**!<br>
As long as you can find somebody who is an expert in them. Spend 1 Treasure to learn a new skill (+4) or improve a skill you already know (+2). You can do that once per skill between each adventure. Alternatively, you can spend a Treasure to learn a new attack from a creature you can train with. Ask the referee.

Spend a Treasure to **hire new hirelings**!<br>
By default you have the choice between a specialist who can sneak and climb, or a fighter who comes equiped with armor and weapons. They have 0 hit points, 5 in all stats and are not suicidal. Each location can have more class options depending on the culture, at the referee's disctretion. Hireling spellcasters know 1 spell. Hiring somebody costs 1 treasure, and they expect to be paid 1 treasure per adventure.

<ins>Are you a magic user?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **research new spells**!<br>
A Treasure spent in research allows to copy one spell from a scroll or spell book into your own spell book. Buying a spell scroll also costs 1 treasure.<br>
A Treasure spent in research allow to create news spells by combining spells using [spell word](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spell-words).

<ins>Do you have access to the dead body of a beast, or other raw materials?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **craft**!<br>
Ask the referee what makes sense to do with the materials, but dont be afraid to give ideas. If a Treasure is spent crafting an object, it will be magical.

<ins>Do you have access to a living beast?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **tame it**!<br>
1 Treasure makes the creature friendly to 1 person. 1 Treasure teaches it a one-word order.

<ins>Do you have access to forbidden eldritch knowledge?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **research eldritch knowledge** and roll on their mutation tables. Some are even beneficial! Each Treasure gives you advantage on that roll.

<ins>Can you talk with a devil or celestial?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **negotiate a pact**: you'll get a gift and a quest. Each Treasure allows you to choose between more options for your gift and quest.

<ins>Do you have a manual about constructs? or access to a real speciment?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **build one**. 1 treasure equals 1 HD of construct.

<ins>Have you captured an elemental spirit?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **bind it to you**: you'll get the power to cast more spells, at a price. Each treasure gives you advantage when rolling the price.

<ins>Have you access to necromantic tomes?</ins><br>
You could spend treasures to **become undead**.

All these tables are in the monster section held by the referee and should be negotiated with them. SoonTM
