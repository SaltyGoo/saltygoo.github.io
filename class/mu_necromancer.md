###### Adapted from Coins & Scrolls's [version](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/11/osr-necromancers.html) and from Nothic's Eye's [version](https://nothicseye.blogspot.com/2022/09/for-qal-ashen.html)

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Black Spellbook, Ink and Quill, And your choice of a Shovel, a Surgeon Kit, or the Skull of your ancestor.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Mortuary Cult Embalmer, Renegade Archeologist, Local Occultist, or Mad Doctor.

For every Necromancer template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and, if you have your spellbook, learn a new **[Necromantic Spell](/spells/#necromancy)**.

**A:** Necromantic Magic, The Threshold of Death<br>
**B:** Harvest <br>
**C:** The Three Faces <br>
**D:** Undeath <br>

## Necromantic Magic
Necromancers get a second random spell from the [Necromancy school](/spells/#necromancy) at level 1. You can alternatively choose to learn the [Lichcraft](/2020/11/13/lichcraft/) spell instead.  They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them. Certain spells are permanent but require a Sigil slot to maintain. You have as many Sigil slots as you have [Scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/)

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Necromancer template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). Triples give 3 Points, and Quadruples, 6 points.

Because you focus on such dark arts, you begin each adventure chased by the Church.

## The Threshold of Death
What is death? You do not die when you reach 0 Hit points. Instead, you simply become unconscious for 10 minutes and gain a [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). However, you still die if you are burned or you have no more room for new scars in you inventory. You can give yourself 1 [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to add 1 SD to a spell you are casting.

## Harvest
Everytime you rest in a cemetary or the location of a massacre, you can recruit a servile [Follower](/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html). This follower is a rotting undead and will be hunted down if understood as such by most humanoids. You can resurect your followers as undeads by inflicting a [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to yourself.

## The Three Faces
Each morning when the sun rises, you choose whether you are Living, Undead, or Dead, with all that implies.

-  If you are living, you can chose what age you have.
-  If you are undead, you heal [dice] when you cast a spell.
-  If you are dead, you are unconscious and your undead followers have as much bonus HP as you have [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).
