<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Gullykin</span>

A halfling village on the Southern Edge of the Woods of Sharp Teeth. A pit-stop along the dangerous Uldoon Trail between Nashkel and the Green Fields. Known for its cider and beer, and the many dangerous ruins that surround it. The chief of the village is the hardy Gandolar Luckyfoot. Notable businesses in the village include a temple of Yondala, goddess of community, and the village's inn, where information on Durlag's Tower and Firewine can be bought.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Brewery</span>

Set atop a hill near the village and surrounded by dusty orchards, Alvanhendar's brewery is the only imposing building in the community. It sells bitter cider, hearty mead and is rumored to owe its success to the nearby elven ruins of Firewine.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Firewine Canyon</span>

A big river obsiously used to course through this now-barren land before wizard meddling diverted it from its course. Whatâ€™s left of it is a barren canyon with sunbleached pebbles at the bottom. The ideal location for an ambush. Following the river leads to Firewine Bridge to the South.
