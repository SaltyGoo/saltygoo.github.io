Stinky trash demon. An aberration.

Imagine a slumbering and bloated hairless green monkey with a bat face. All it wants is to create the biggest pile of rotting flesh.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** like a very dumb and evil chimp <br>
**Movement:** slow <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As an aberration, the dretch *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally, it can also smell non-rotting things very well and is immune to poison.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Claw.</ins> The dretch makes two melee attacks (1D6).

<ins>Fetid Cloud.</ins> The dretch expels a putrid cloud that lightly covers the area around it, lasting 1 minute. Creatures must succeed on a saving throw against poison or be nauseated while the in the cloud.

<span class="alchemy">**Dretch Musk.** Save or be poisoned. Only lasts 10 minutes but affects anyone who smells it.</span>

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The most common and least powerful of all demons according to Jim Holloway in the [Monster Manual II](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/17005/Monster-Manual-II-1e). I wanted to keep them pretty close to the original. â€” SaltyGoo
