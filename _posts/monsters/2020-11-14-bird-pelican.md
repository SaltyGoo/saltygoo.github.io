*Sea birds that swallow whole. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *From having run the [Sky Blind Spire](http://blog.trilemma.com/2016/04/the-sky-blind-spire.html). â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a cart-sized sea bird with a long pouch-beak.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 7 / 4 / 4 / 1 / 6 / 4 <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Pelicans have a very good sense of sight.

**Attacks:** Each round, the pelican can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Swallow</ins>. The pelican makes an attempt to grapple a target. On a success, the target t is stuck in its beak pouch. While there, it cannot use any weapon bigger than a dagger. 

<ins>Subdue</ins>. The pelican squishes its beak pouch on its chest to crush whatever is inside (x). If it the creature is attempting to hold its breath, it must make a save or lose as much constitution.

<ins>Gulp</ins>. The pelican skims a water pond and fills its pouch with water. As long as it is filled, creatures inside cannot breath or speak.

<ins>Shake</ins>. The pelican violently shake its head. A creature in its pouch must save or be stunned for a round.
