**R**: 90'  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

When you cast this spell, choose a metal : tin, iron, copper, bronze or brass. You touch the ground and percieve ...
 
 - **Tin** : You perceive sound happening near tin in the area. It's muffled.
 - **Iron** : You detect all iron in the area.
 - **Copper** : Nothing near copper can be detected by magic or senses other than sight.
 - **Bronze** : You detect all magic or spellcasting near bronze.
 - **Brass** : The emotions of sentient beings near brass are suppressed.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](https://saltygoo.github.io/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent in that area.
