title: Trap Lightning
---
R: 120â€™		D: Sigil

You must first have prepared a trap, such as a bottle or copper rod, with your Sigil and then set out under an open sky in a cosmically enticing manner, which will draw the lightning. 

By speaking the words of the spell, the trapped lightning may be discharged, doing [sum] damage to all in the path of the bolt. When used as a melee weapon, an undischarged lightning rod will knock back human-sized targets and deal 1D4+[dice] lightning damage.
