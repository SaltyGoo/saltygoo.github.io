title: GLOGmas 2025 - Phlox's Library
---

Hello! I have the huge privilege of having drawn Phlox of **Phlox's GLoG Server** fame as my GLoGmas inspiration. I am lucky because this gives me the opportunity to be actually grateful for once! For people only interested in the gameable content, just skip the next paragraph because I'm about to be heartfelt.

I remember being a disillusionned 5e DM in 2019, stumbling with excitement upon the OSR scene, being intimidated and awed by the big bloggers of the time (haha), then recoiling at the angry-old-dudeness of it all, and breathing a sigh of relief when reading the silly-ass GLoG wizards schools and joining the server. I may not have been the most active poster in my five years there, but I am definitely happy! You really have managed to foster a great community of disparate people who elevate, support and steal each other's ideas in a joyful way that is so refreshing to me. At first I was wondering who the fuck puts their name in front a Discord server, but I realise now that it perfectly captures the camaraderie of a bunch of gretchling squatting your basement and having fun. I am sure I am not the only one who was able to grow a lot creatively because you provided this cool space. Happy GLoGmas!

# Phlox's Library

Somebody joked this year that I took hours of their work on a blog post and reduced it to a four-lines spellbook. Well, here I go again: **Four months of Phlox's writing (sept-december) distilled into 5 spellbooks for my [wizard](/class/wizard) class!**
