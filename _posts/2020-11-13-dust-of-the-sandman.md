R: 60’		D: [dice]*10 minutes

Sparkling dust conjured from the land of dreams blankets a small melee, and all within fall asleep. Saving throws apply.

If you also invested 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set the only condition that will cause the creatures to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.).

###### sleep + dust
