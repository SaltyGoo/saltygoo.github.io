R: 60’ 		D: [dice] hours

Hostile creatures become neutral, neutral creatures become friendly, and friendly creatures become infatuated and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them for the duration. Friendly creatures will be open to serving you, given some basic incentive, and infatuated creatures require no incentive. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
