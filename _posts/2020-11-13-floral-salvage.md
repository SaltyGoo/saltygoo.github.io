R: Touch 

As you touch a target, flowers erupt from its wounds. It takes 1 damage for every unhealed point of damage it has already taken, not exceeding [sum]*2. If this damage kills the target, their corpse is entirely consumed by plant growth, and turns into a beautiful flower-covered tree measuring 2D4 times the creature’s HD in feet.
