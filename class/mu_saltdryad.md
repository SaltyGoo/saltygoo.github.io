_You are the courtesan of minerals ..._

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Powdered Makeup Palette, and your choice of a Crystal Fan (use as a dagger), an Asbestos Scarf (fireproof and toxic), or three Vials full of brine (preserve organic matter).

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Geology, and your choice of Earth Court, Fay Court, or Ooze Court

For every Salt Dryad template you have, you gain one **Crystal Ornament**.

**A:** Fey, Crystal Ornament, Elemental Etiquette <br>
**B:** Curing Touch <br>
**C:** The Nuanced Art of Elemental Diplomacy <br>
**D:** Salt of the Earth<br>

## Fey
Iron makes you [poisoned](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for 10 minutes upon contact during which you cannot use your powers.

## Crystal Ornament
For each Salt Dryad template you have and each time you rest submerged in water, you gain an **Ornament**. These ornaments are made of salt and each have a unique shape of your choosing.

Each ornament is the vessel of one Salt Dryad Spell. When worn, you gain a Spell Dice (SD) and you can [cast its spell](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). When you expend a SD casting a spell, that **Ornament** disappears and you lose its effect.

You can lend these ornaments and their power to other people. However, as long as they wear the gift, they are [Charmed](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) by you.

## Elemental Etiquette
You can talk to Earth, Fire, Air and Water. Earth is conservative and in no rush to make a decision; Fire is greedy and impulsive; Air is in a hurry and easily swayed; Water is moody depending on its form, but always hostile to you.

## Curing Touch
Your touch inflicts terrible pain to wounded creatures, but it also kills bacteria. When you touch a wounded living or water based creature with less than half its hit points, the creature is [Dazed](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) by pain for 10 minutes and automatically succeeds a save to remove the symptoms of a disease if any.

## The Nuanced Art of Elemental Diplomacy
When you give an **Ornament** to someone, you can decide to taint the gift with a secret connotation only percieved by elemental creatures and natural phenomena. 

Choose one element or phenomena and wether that gift is offensive or pleasing to them. As long as the person carries your gift, it will be percieved accordingly by this element or phenomena, as interpreted by the referee. 

## Salt of the Earth
You cannot take back a gift. You create two new **Ornaments** every time you rest submerged in water. You and creatures creatures wearing one of your **Ornament** gifts do not need to breathe and can take 10 minutes to meld into stone.
