D: Sigil

Trace your Sigil on a hand mirror, which proves to be of great defence against other spellcasters: anyone casting a noxious spell while seeing their own image in the mirror will have the spell flung back at them.

Holding the mirror correctly does not impede magic but requires a hand and minumum of effort: you can change the reflected subject as they do other actions. The mirror reflects [dice] spell dices before losing its powers. Reflecting a spell reflected by another heka mirror provokes a Catastrophe.
