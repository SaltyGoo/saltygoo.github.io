<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A black goat. A forked dagger. A capirote. A spell book, a quill, but no ink.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Secret Cultist, Lazy Student, or Corrupted Courtesan.

For every Diabolist template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and **[Diabolic Spell](/spells/#diabolism)**.

**A:** Diabolic Spells, Doomed Pact<br>
**B:** Familiar <br>
**C:** Second Sight <br>
**D:** Arcane Communion, Familiar II <br>

## Diabolic Spells
Diabolists get a random spell from the [diabolist school](/spells/#diabolism) at level 1. They’re stored in spell books and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Diabolist template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles or a 6 you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles or a 6 you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

Because of the taboo you've broken as a diabolist, you also gain a Doom Point each time you roll a 6 on a Spell Dice.

## Doomed Pact
You can clear all your Doom Points by performing a random obligation for a devil (roll 1D8 on both the obligation and sin tables):
