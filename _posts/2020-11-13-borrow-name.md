**R**: Touch  **D**: [dice] hours

You steal the target's name. Nobody can remember the target's name in the meantime. You immediately benefit from all spells, curses, geasas, and other magical effects that were affecting the target as these things follow the name. Target cannot save if you know its name. You can have multiple names at the same time.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent.

Be careful! Stealing an extraplanar entity's name will cause its eternal enmity. Each hour you own the name, there's a 2/6 chance that you are summoned back to its homeplane where you now belong.
