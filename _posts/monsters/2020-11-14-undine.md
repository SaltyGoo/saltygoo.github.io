*Water elementals that long for the chaos of a mortal life. Elemental and Fairy.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Adapting the undine was difficult: like most elementals, the [DnD version](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elemchfw.html) of the creature is pretty unimaginative in both shape and ability (its a stronger water weird with spells). In this case however, the real life counterpart of the myth is fascinating: not only it is at the origin of the concept of an elemental creature, but also the inspiration behind the story of the Little Mermaid (elemental creatures are immortal but have no soul, if they marry a human, they become mortals but gain an eternal soul). I decided to take the powers of the DnD creature and flavor it as the original myth. Also, because the undine is an elemental that dreams, I made it fairy as well. — SaltyGoo* </span>

The Undine has two forms: a beautiful humanoid, its skin the color of a stormy wave or frothy waters and hair that is liquid, or an amorphous blob of water with multiple apendages. It speaks like a glass harp.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 8 / 6 / 5 / 4 / 7 <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average, swim fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

**Spellcasting:** Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Dust to Water, Geas

The undine is made of pure water: it can squeeze through any hole and is invisible while submerged. It can be frozen or boiled, in which case it loses all resistances.

**Water:** On its turn, if the undine is not in contact with water, it takes 1D4 points of damage.

**Shape Change:** The undine can change shape between a blob of water and a humanoid at will. It only has a walking speed if its in humanoid form, and a swim speed in blob form. Its attacks are also different.

**Blob Attacks:** Each round, the undine in blob shape can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Slam</ins>. The undine makes a melee attack (x) with a water tentacle which can reach anywhere nearby.

<ins>Grapple</ins>. The undine makes a grapple attack against any nearby target.

## Binding the Elemental

You gain a [Spell Dice](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells), one Doom Point and ...

1. ... you plane-shift to a random location in the plane of air.
1. ... you are under a permanent levitation spell. 
1. ... your weight is halved, you have disadvantage on strength checks. 
1. ... you are under a permanent feather-fall.
1. ... you hover.
1. ... the spell word *Travel*. 

If you roll a catastrophe, the elemental is released.

## Conjuring an Airwalker

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 1 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Aerial Servant** <br>
R: self 

When casting the spell the caster must join hands with up to [dice] people. The airwalker will then ask each participant why they seek access to the plane of air. If the motive is anything beyond personal freedom, the person must succeed a charisma check to successfully lie to the elemental. If everybody passes the check, the airwalker planeshifts the group to the location of their choice in the plane of air.
