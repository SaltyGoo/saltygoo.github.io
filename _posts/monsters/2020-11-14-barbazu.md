Snake-bearded devil soldier. A celestial.

Imagine a humanoid with blue or red skin, goat horns, a lizard tail, and, even more disturbingly, a beard made of hissing snakes. It holds a barbed glaive.

Barbazus (also known as bearded devils) conscript wayward souls to war against the enemies of the gods. When seen on the material plane, they are often in a punitive expedition.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** chain <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** strong and sturdy  <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As a celestial being, the Barbazu *resists everything* and is *immune to curses*. Additionnally, the Barabzu can *see in the dark* and communicates through *telepathy*.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Platinum Barbed Glaive.</ins> The barbazu makes a melee attack (1D8) with reach. A living creature must then save or take (1D4) nonlethal damage at the beginning of its turn. The effect can be ended with a successful medicine check or any other healing.

<ins>Snake Beard.</ins>  The barbazu makes a melee attack (1D6) with its beard. On a hit, the target must make a save vs poison or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, it cannot heal. The target can attempt a save again at the end of each of its turns.

<ins>Spellcasting (1)</ins> *Thaumaturgy, Control Flames, Cause Fear*

<ins>Summon Lemures</ins> (recharge 2/6). The barbazu summons 1D4 lemures which appear in 1D4 turns.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Barbazus are very cool mechanically with their unique attacks, but also aesthetically, seamlessly fitting christian, persian and indian depictions of demons. Sadly, since their first introduction, they have lost most of their magical powers. Compared to [the Monster Manual (5e)](https://5e.tools/book.html#mm), I brought back the spellcasting and tried to give them a sense of purpose besides being army grunts. â€” SaltyGoo
