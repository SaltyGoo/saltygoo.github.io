Flesh-eating spirit bully. A fey.

Imagine an ogre with wickedly intelligent eyes and small horns. Its red, white or blue skin shines like lacquer.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy, clever and suave. <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As a fairy, the oni *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the oni regenerates 2 HP per round and sees in the dark.

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Illusionism, Metamorphosis, Witchcraft.

**Attacks (2/round)**

<ins>Cold Iron Club</ins>. The oni makes a melee attack (1D8).

<ins>Punch</ins>. The oni makes a melee attack (1D6).

<ins>Spellcasting (3).</ins> *Charm Person, Frost Breath, Gaseous Form, Sleep.*

<ins>Vanish.</ins> The oni becomes invisible.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>
 
You find a large and heavy cold iron club, a lacquered wood mask of the oni's face, and 1D4 trinkets from previous victims:

1. A pious monk.
2. An innocent shepherd.
3. A lost child.
4. A warrior.
5. A fey.
6. A beast.

Wearing the mask gives the wicked inspiration to create a spell with the word *ogre*.
