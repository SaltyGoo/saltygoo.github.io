**R**: Voice **D**: [sum] minutes

As long as you interact with the target in a non-threatening manner, their emotions are calmed and muted. The target knows that their emotions are being muted and they may save to break the effect, but they cannot otherwise respond in a manner more threatening than a stoner that is four hits in on their favorite kush. Calm suppresses the effects of Fear, Rage, Ecstasy, Pain, Heroism or other similarly emotion based effectsâ€“but those effects come back once the duration of Calm ends.
