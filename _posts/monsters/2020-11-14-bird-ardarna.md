Elusive magical bird of beauty. A fey.

Imagine an iridescent bird of unreal beauty. Seeing it makes you want to cry. In fact, most of you are crying right now.

As a fairie, the adarna bird *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. 

Additionally, the adarna bird is so hearbreakingly beautiful that creatures must succeed an INT check to see it and all plants and objects near it when it dies are changed as if they had spent a year in a dusty, sunless attic. 

Adarna bird guano petrifies sleeping creatures upon contact.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Soothing Song</ins>. Anybody hearing the adarna bird sing must save or fall asleep until the song ends (1D4+1 minutes), after which, the adarna bird changes color and all must make a new intelligence check to see it.

*The adarna bird appears in the Filipino epic poem of the same name by José de la Cruz. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) is very close to the original. For my version, I removed the piercing shriek (too violent for a creature of beauty), made it a fey, and more importantly, added the petrifying shit back from the original story, because it's hilarious. — SaltyGoo*
