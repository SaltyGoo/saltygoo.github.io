---

You summon Phanuel the Seraph. A burning golden light concealed behind six lustrous red wings. Smoke pours out constantly from behind the wings, smelling like myrrh and cedar. Her halo is like lightning suspended in motion. Occasionally, she will project a form resembling a woman made of smoke with candle-flame eyes to speak with her summoners. Calm and hopeful. 

Phanuel will suspend hatred, feuds or rivalries between two people or two groups for [dice] days. 

Phanuel will give you immunity to fear, anxiety and despair for [dice] days. 

Phanuel will render [dice] explosive, flammable, poisonous or toxic objects inert and harmless. 

Phanuel will give you [dice] [Doom Points](/list/spell-catastrophe) if you have ever denied the needy charity.
