Sentient fire. A fire elemental.

Imagine fire moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in sizzles and flickers.

**HD:** X  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** any <br>
**Stats:** agile, dumb and impulsive <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As elemental fire, the fire elemental *resists all damage* and is *immune to fire*. It *recovers X HP* every round spent in water and *takes 1D4 damage* each round spent without fluel. In general, it has the same properties as fire such as shedding light and being snuffed by water. 

As a gaseous creature, the fire elemental cant be petrified or grappled, hit by mundane weapons and can fit into any hole. However, winds can hurt it like a sword. Additionally, the fire elemental can shape flames at will.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Incinerate</ins>. The elemental makes a melee attack (XD4 damage). On a hit, the target can choose to take an extra 1D4 damage, or sacrifice an item to the flames.

<ins>Create Flames</ins> (X/day). The elemental can start a 5' fire on a flammable object nearby.
