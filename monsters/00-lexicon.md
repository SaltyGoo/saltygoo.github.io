**HD:** Hit Dice, roll as many D8s to calculate the monster's hit points (HP).

**Size:** tiny (cat and smaller), small (kid), medium (adult), large (horse, ogre), huge (elephant, windmill), gargantuan (whale and bigger)

**Stats:** str / dex / con / int / wis / cha <br>*double for 3D6 system, subtract 5 for 5e-style stat bonus*

**Resistances:** halves damage and gives advantage on saves <br>"weapon" means blunt/pierce/slash damage, "mind" includes things like charm and fear

**Armor:** damage resistance: leather (2), chain (4), plate (6). Never reduces damage below 1.

**Damage:** the damage the monster makes across its attacks

**Movement:** static, slow (0), average (5), fast (10)

**Morale:** coward (flees at first wound), brave (flees at 50% HP), reckless (stays as long as it could kill a PC in one shot), mindless (never flees).

**Spellcasting:** *Monster spells do not match the players' spell list, but are named so the referee can interpret their effect easily. The goal is to speed things up: teleporting and resurrecting might be dangerous endeavours for PCs, but pretty straightforward for monsters who can do it innately.
Monsters rarely spend more than 3 spell dices on a single spell, and they have as many spell dices as their HD* 

Minor abilities that relate more to how the monster lives live darkvision, keen smell and water breathing are listed in one paragraph.

**Major Abilities:** Abilities that affect combat are highlighted as such.

**Attacks:** Each round, a monster can perform a certain number of actions listed. Of course context might call for new ones at the referee's discretion.

<ins>Actual Attack.</ins> A melee attack hits an adjacent target, a melee attack with reach can hit targets behind adjacent ones, a short range means within 1 turn of movement, a ranged attack means far. Damage is listed in the sats above. When an attack has (2x) in it, it means the attack does twice the number of damage dices.
