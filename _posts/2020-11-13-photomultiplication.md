**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] rounds

You transform a light source into a radiating ball of astral light blasting all creatures near it. They takes [sum] damage and must save or be [stunned](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for [dice] rounds. The light source is then dimmed an unusable for [dice] rounds.

If 4 or more dice are invested in this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the blast becomes permanent and can be used as a portal to the astral plane if one survives the irradiation.
