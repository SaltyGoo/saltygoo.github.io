<span class="alchemy"> *This was initially a monster class for the [ogre](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/ogre), but it could be reflavored as any big bully. — SaltyGoo* </span>

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Club, 1 ration.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Smashing.

For every Ogre template you have, you get more fat (it takes one skill slot), you grow 1’ .

**A:** Belly, Mouth<br>
**B:** Smash<br>
**C:** Bully<br>
**D:** Strength of Food<br>

## Belly
For each skill slot you have taken by fat, increase your maximum HP by 2. When in town between adventures, each Treasure spent carousing can give you more fat if you want.

## Mouth
You can eat any object bigger than a chicken and softer than metal as a ration. If you dont eat the equivalent of two rations per day, you lose 1 layer of fat.

## Smash
You can replace your melee damage rolls with the number of skill slots you have taken by fat.

## Bully
Once per encounter, you can give a one-word command to a creature that is smaller than you. The creature can choose to fall prone instead of obeying the order.

## Strength of Food
You take half damage from the last thing you ate and you have advantage on your rolls to destroy it if it was an object. If it was a magic item, you gain its powers.
