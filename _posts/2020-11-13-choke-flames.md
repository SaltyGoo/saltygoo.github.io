title: Smothering Smoke
---
**R**: 30 **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You quash flames in the area of this spell, creating a great deal of smoke. Torches fill a 10’ cube with smoke, bonfires fill a 30’ cube with smoke. If you cast this spell with 3 or more [dice], living creatures lose 1 HP per round while they remain in the smoke. Wind dissipates the smoke in 10 minutes. 

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the smoke stays until dissipated.
