title: Bird, Hawk
---

_Imagine a small bird with aerodynamic wings, piercing yellow eyes and feathers that alternate between brown, gray and white. The hawk is a diurnal predator._

Fast predatory sky-diving bird. A tiny beast.

Hawks will not attack prays bigger than them unless trained to do so or defending their nest. They are only active during the day.

## So, You Are Hunting Hawks?

New carousing activities!

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame the Beast</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of gold (2 for a giant hawk) in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Craft from Beast Parts</summary>
Hawk’s meat has a dry, leathery texture, but is still edible. Its feathers are prized by bowyers.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. If you use mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spent at least a bag of gold on it, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.
