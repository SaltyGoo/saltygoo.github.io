title: Spider, Astral Spinner
---

Parasitic spiders dwelling in the astral plane but preying on the material. A beast.

Imagine a foot-long hairless spider the color of polished silver. Its hollow abdomen holds an eye-sized gelatinous orb filled with red, blue or purple liquid.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** average, climb average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Spiders can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, with little difficulty. They are connected to their web and can feel anything that touches it. The astral spinner's web is made of pure silver coated in sticky fluid and exists both in the astral and material world. A body part wrapped in it cease to exist in the material world.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bind.</ins> The astral spinner goads a creature into tangling itself even more in its web. On a failed save, roll a new grappled body part. If 3 or more body parts are grappled, 1D4 more astral spinners phase in.

<ins>Phase.</ins> The astral spinner switches between the astral plane and the material plane.

The cactus cat is an cryptid from the South-Western United-State. In the myth, it gets drunk and violent on fermented cactus sap. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)’s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) gives it hallucinogenic quills. I say why not both? The drunken confusion mechanic is something my table would enjoy a lot. — SaltyGoo
