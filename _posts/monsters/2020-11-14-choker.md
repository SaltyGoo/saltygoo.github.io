*Robbery humanoid stranglers. Aberration.*

<span class="alchemy"> *I love chokers. I think the 2e [version](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/choker.html) has the best illustration. And I really love Junji Ito's "The Enigma of Amigara Fault" in Gyo as a freaky origin story/scenario idea. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a rubbery, hairless, small human that would have been stretched to normal size. Has rows of sharp teeth and toothed tentacles instead of feet and hands.

It is animalistic, living to hunt and breed. It hates loud noises and being seen.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 7 / 6 / 2 / 6 / 3 <br>
**Resistances:** mind, grapple <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** average, climb fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

The choker can see in the dark and squeeze in openings as small as 4 square inches. It can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down, without making a check. Hidden chokers are very hard to spot.

**Aberration:** To kill an aberration, one must succeed on a save vs. fear. On a failure, it survives with 1 HP.

**Aberrant Quickness** (recharge 2/6): The choker can take a second action on its turn. 

**Attacks:**  Each round, the choker can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Choke.</ins> The choker makes a melee attack (x) and grapples a creature on a hit. Only one creature can be choked at a time. A choking creature is mute and takes (x) damage at the end of each of its turns.

<ins>Whip.</ins> The choker makes a melee attack (x) against a creature or an object nearby. The choker is pulled to it.
