[All monsters](/list/monsters)<br>
[How to read a monster stat block](/monsters/lexicon)

## By Monster Type
I classify monsters in 8 thematic categories with some mechanical common thread, because I love when players can learn:

[Aberrations](/list/monsters-aberration) (Mutants and Aliens)<br>
[Beasts](/list/monsters-beast) (Animals and Plants)<br>
[Constructs](/list/monsters-construct) (Machines) <br>
[Divine](/list/monsters-celestial) (Angels and Devils) <br>
[Elementals](/list/monsters-elemental) <br> (Air, Earth, Fire and Water)
[Fairies](/list/monsters-fey) <br> (Magical tricksters)
[Humanoids](/list/monsters-humanoid) (People) <br>
[Undeads](/list/monsters-undead) <br> (Other monsters brought back to life)

[NPC Classes](/list/monsters-classes) <br> (When you want your bear to be a wizard too)
