title: Cloak of [Element]
---

D: [dice]*10 minutes

This spell must be cast in presence of a significant amount of [element]. You invite an elemental spirit to take a ride on your back. For some, it looks like a cloak made of pure [element], for some others, it looks like a strange creature piggy-backing on you. For the duration of the spell, when you are hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes [dice] points of damage and you are immune to [element]. The spell ends if the elemental spirit is washed or snuffed away.

If the spell ends naturally, the elemental spirit will stay wherever you drop it and might change the area over the course of days.
