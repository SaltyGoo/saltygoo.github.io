<button id="generateText" >Generate Encounter</button> <br>

<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for information on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Nashkel Pass</span>

The Trade Way gets narrower here as carves through the escarpments. The tall dark pines that tower ominously over the road could be hiding many ambushers.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Nashkel River</span>

A sturdy stone bridge crosses the alpine river that links Nashkel to Fisherman's Lake. The idyllic view cannot make you shake the feeling of being watched.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Hobgoblin Camp</span>

Hobgoblins from the Chill company have set camp here to catch shipments of iron coming from the Nashkel mines.
