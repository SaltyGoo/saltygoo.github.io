**R**: Touchâ€ƒ

As you touch a target, flowers erupt from its wounds. It takes 0.5 x [dice] damage for every unhealed point of damage it has already taken. If this damage kills the target, their corpse is entirely consumed by plant growth, and turns into a beautiful flower-covered tree measuring [sum] feet.
