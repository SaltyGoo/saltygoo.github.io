## Body Oil
Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to produce enough oil to cover one human-sized creature or object, or a 10' square flat space. This oil is highly slippery, highly flammable and dries up in 1 hour. It smells like you.
## Oiled Up I
While you are oiled up, you have advantage when you attempt to seduce or charm.
## Oiled Up II
While you are oiled up, you cannot be grappled.
## Scoundrel
When you succeed in a fighting maneuver, you can plant or steal a small object on your opponent without being notice.
## Oiled Up III
When you are oiled up and an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you can make a fighting maneuver against it.
## Font of Shine
You can use your Body Oil ability twice per day.
## Spitfire
You can create a spark by snapping your fingers. Instead of using your Body Oil ability, you can spit a cone of fire and ignite 2 adjacent nearby targets. The cone inflicts 2D6 fire damage, halved on a save. Targets who fail their save continue taking 1 damage every round until they extinguish the flames.
