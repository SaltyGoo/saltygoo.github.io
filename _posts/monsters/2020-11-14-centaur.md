*Human-horse hybrid. Humanoid*

<span class="alchemy"> *Compared to the [5th edition](https://5e.tools/book.html#mm) version, I gave it more interactive attacks. Also, considering the contemporary association of centaurs with wisdom, I made them resistant to some fairy tricks. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine the upper body of a human joined to the body of a horse. They shun clothes and prefer a nomadic life to the confinement of cities.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / 7 / 7 / 4 / 6 / 5 <br>
**Resistances:** charm, sleep <br>
**Armor:** none (as worn) <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Centaurs have exceptional endurance and very keen eyes.

**Attacks:**  Each round, the centaur can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Pike Drag.</ins> The centaur makes one melee attack (x) and may move nearby with the target.
