**D**: [dice] rounds

You hum a timeless tune, so that many beings borne on a different dimension within earshot from you resonate in the specific harmony of their original sphere. 

The first round is enough to notice the presence of the beings and their origin, but not precisely their location. Each subsequent round can be used to identify one specific being or one information about a group of them.
