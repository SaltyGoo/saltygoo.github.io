You summon Shamsiel the Dominion. A long-limbed woman wreathed in bright fire and fragrant smoke. An athletic, attractive man, his face and hair hidden behind branches bearing apple-tree leaves that seem to grow from the air behind his head. He wears a cream-coloured shirt, a maroon waistcoat, and maroon suit-trousers. His wings are warm, downy white, and his halo is like the dawn, casting beams of light through the leaves and branches of his head. His shoes are black, polished to reflectivity. He carries a burning longsword of pure flame in his right hand.Irritable and charming. 

Shamsiel will guard a location you direct him to for [dice] hours, preventing any human from entering or passing by. He does this with persuasion and, if need be, his blade. He will always let past innocents, people fleeing danger, or people you command him to.

Shamsiel will give you [dice] blessed apples that cure bacterial diseases and restore 1D6HP when bitten into. 

Shamsiel will make sure everyone you meet knows who you are for [dice] days. 

Shamsiel will give you [dice] [Doom Points](/list/spell-catastrophe) if you’ve trespassed anywhere you weren’t meant to within the last month. (It ticks him off.)
