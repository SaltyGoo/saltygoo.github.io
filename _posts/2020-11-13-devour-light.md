**R**: 60'  **D**: [sum] rounds

Darkness descend upon a sphere of 30' radius at a point you designate. It drowns most light sources but can be dissolved by very strong light.

You may also pick one of the following options for each [dice] invested:

- You can see normally through the darkness.
- Distances in the darkness are doubled.
- Anything in the darkness takes half damage from non weapon attacks.
- Anything in the darkness have disadvantage on their saves against your other spells.
- The darkness moves with you.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
