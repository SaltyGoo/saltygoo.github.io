---

Armored centipede with a flaming breath attack. A beast.

Imagine a bright-red centipede as long as a dog. It eats burnt organic matter.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile but weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** average, climb average<br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Dracopedes can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, with little difficulty. They cant see well but detects nearby movement. Red dracopedes are resist fire.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (1D4).

<ins>Defensive Curl.</ins> The dracopede curls into a ball. As long as it stays in this position, it cannot move or attack, nor be damaged by missile weapons and one-handed melee weapons.

<ins>Flammable Spray (recharge 2/6).</ins> The dracopede spits flammable acid in a short cone. Those who fail their dodge take acid damage (1D4). And fire damage (D4) every turn until the sticky liquid is removed.

This attack has no effect in cool temperatures.

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<summary>Credits</summary>
Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. â€” SaltyGoo
