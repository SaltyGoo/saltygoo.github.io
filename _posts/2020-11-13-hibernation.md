**R**: Touch  **D**+: [dice] x 10 minutes

The target falls into a magical slumber and can't be woken by anything less vigorous than a slap (a standard action). Non-alert, unaware targets are not allowed a Save. While asleep, the target appears very pale, with bluish lips, cold skin and no visible breath. It also no longer needs to eat or drink, and if it was dying, it doesn't until the spell ends.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent and you can set the only condition that will cause the target to awake (the sunrise before the apocalypse, true loveâ€™s kiss, etc.).
