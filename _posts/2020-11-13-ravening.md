**R**: 30’ 		**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

The growth processes of [dice] [beasts](/list/monsters-beast) are accelerated, inducing ravenous hunger. 

If sufficient food is not available, the creatures will attempt to consume anything nearby, and will gain sustenance from materials not normally consumable, such as wood or dirt, though food or flesh is preferred. Roll a D6 for each animal targetted: 

**1**, It grows until it becomes gargantuan (10HD) and is driven insane. <br>
**2-5,** It doubles in size for the duration of the spell (double HP) and then collapse into unconsciousness afterwards. <br>
**6**, It doubles in size permanently. <br>
