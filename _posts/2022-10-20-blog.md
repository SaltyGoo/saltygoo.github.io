These are some of the various byproducts that pop off when I adapt a random DnD [monster]([url](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters)) to the Glog.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Adarna Guano</b></summary>
_The [adarna bird](/monsters/bird-adarna) is as elusive as it is beautiful, and many moral fables have been written about vain parvenus dying on their quest to capture it. These tales overshadow the more nefarious usage of the bird's droppings, which royal alchemists suspect have been used in a kidnapping plot against a princess. Expires after 1D6 days._

<span class="alchemy">**Adarna Guano.** [Petrifies](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) a sleeping creature upon contact with their bare skin.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Arassas Bile</b></summary>
_Corrosive antifreeze used by [Cat-Dragons](/monsters/arassas) to carve their meandering tunnel-dens through glaciers. Experienced hunters from mountain clans prefer using chamois leather to scrape the leftovers on the tunnel walls over risking their lives attempting to harvest it from the dangerous beast's stomach._

<span class="alchemy">**Arassas Bile.** Corrosive liquid (1D6). Prevents freezing, but renders vulnerable to cold damage.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Arctic Bat Venom</b></summary>
_Used by many northerners to preserve food, [arctic bat](/monsters/bat-arctic) venom can also be very lethal and subtle in the right conditions: what kills the victim is actually hypothermia. _

<span class="alchemy">**Arctic Bat Venom.** Save or be poisoned, save again each day to cure. You are [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) in subzero temperatures.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Barbazu Beard Sebum</b></summary>
_Bearded devils line roads with the crucified bodies of sinners to advertise the efficiency._

<span class="alchemy">**[Barbazu](/monsters/barbazu) Beard Sebum.** Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Prevents hit point recovery.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Basilisk Eye</b></summary>
_Sought after by wizards and masons alike, [Basilisk](/monsters/basilisk) Eyes must be kept hydrated and in the dark at all time and have no powers if harvested more than an hour after the beast's death._

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Eye**. Tiny portal to the elemental plane of earth. If exposed to light will start excreting enough concrete to fill a 5' cube.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Basilisk Venom</b></summary>
_This deadly venom is prized by assassins for its capacity to be poured through stone floors into the kitchen of unfortunate targets. It's even more prized by adventurers wanting a way to free a petrified comrade._

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Venom.** Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Fail 4 times and die. Drips through stone and cures [petrification](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Cacus Body Oil</b></summary>
_The semi-nomadic [cacus](/monsters/cacus) giants are known to use this oil to cover their bodies before wrestling, but also to breathe fire and cook. They have no problem selling it to prospective buyers, but they also have no problem scamming them._

<span class="alchemy"> **Cacus Body Oil**. Highly slippery, highly flammable, and highly flavourful.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Cadejo Musk</b></summary>
_The [cadejos](/monsters/cadejo) are mystical dogs that guide spirits and drunkards in and out of the land of the dead. They rarely reveal themselves to people seeking them, but those who manage acquire their musk can mingle with ghosts without trouble._

<span class="alchemy">**Cadejo Musk.** One dose spread on the neck will make the wearer appear dead to undead creatures.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leech Drool</b></summary>
_This basic medicinal component would be pretty common if the quantities required to cover a wound were not disproportionately large compared to the common leech. However, swamp and tunnel dwellers have learned to harvest it from giant leech species and [bloodbeasts](/monsters/bloodbeast)._

<span class="alchemy">**Leech Drool**. Prevents scarring and pain from an open wound.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Luck Powder</b></summary>
_The jungle [fruit-fairies](/monsters/aziza) grow strange fruits in the shape of dead tresspassers. When these fruits are dried and grounded, they produce the drug colloquialy known as "Powdered Luck". Many adventurers grow apoplectic and terrorized of failure after relying too much on it._

<span class="alchemy">**Luck Powder.** For 10 minutes, you cannot roll below 10. For a session after your first snort, you must carry an aziza on your shoulder (taking an inventory slot). You get two azizas after your second snort, etc. You and fairies are the only ones who can see or hear them. They are chatty.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Iron Apple Seed</b></summary>
_Grown in the mist along leylines by the mysterious three-armed [athach giants](/monsters/athach) and jealously garded by them, Iron Apple Trees make for an exotic garden feature. Notably, the fruits produced can be smelted to forge [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) weapons tailor-made to kill fairies._

<span class="alchemy"> **Iron Apple Seed**. If planted in hard rock along a leyline and watered, it will grow into a tree producing [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) apples.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Vyderac Pheromones</b></summary>
_The deadly tropical [vyderac beetles](/monsters/beetle-vyderac) spray this fine yellow powder to attract their swarm to a potential pray. As deadly as it is irritating, the pheromones will lure 1D4 vyderac swarms in 1D6 hours if used in the jungle. This property is actually the most dangerous, as whole villages have been known to be have been consumed by the Swarm after a pheromone bomb was planted in it._

<span class="alchemy"> **Vyderac Pheromones**. Contact poison. So itchy, a sprayed target must save each round until they succeed three times or are washed, during which time they cannot focus on any task that extends beyond 1 turn. If they fail three times, they have scratched themselves until they bleed and the poison has entered their body. In 10 minutes, they will be completely [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until they are cured.</span>

Vyderac pheromones are also found in liquid, acidic form when harvested from larvae and queens.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Willow Death</b></summary>
_One of the most potent, if simple, toxin is produced by the [olitiau clawed bat](/monsters/bat-olitiau). A single dose of this poison can be harvested from each of these deadly fluffy critters, but few dare disturbing their colonies._

<span class="alchemy"> **Olitiau Venom**. Save or start [dying](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). </span>
