title: Phase Shift
---
**R**: 60'  **D**: [sum] rounds

The form of the elements is fluid. Even when they change, their nature is the same, and you understand that. [dice] x 5' cube of target element changes state by one phase (solid>liquid>gaseous), though its temperature does not change. Targets must be of similar substance and undergo the same phase change. If you invest 4 or more [dice], targets can change state by two phases.
