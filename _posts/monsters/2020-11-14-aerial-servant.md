*Air elemental specialized in abductions.*

###### Elemental. Adapted from [AD&D 2e](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elekaase.html)

Imagine a nearly invisible, legless humanoid made of sparkling blue smoke. They are most often bound to a mission to capture a prey when met, but would love to kill their summoner even more. 

When free, they serve as messengers  between gods.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 10 / 7 / 3 / 5 / 3 <br>
**Immunities:** electricity, grapple, petrification, sleep <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The aerial servant loses all resistances if it is prone or cant move.

As a gaseous creature, it can fit into any hole. It always knows the exact location of its target if it is clearly identified.

**Attacks:** Each round, the aerial servant can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Crush</ins>. The aerial servant makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Ethereal Shift</ins>. The servant shifts between the ethereal and physical worlds. It is visible in either, but cant affect or be affected by anything in the plane it isn’t. 

<ins>Smother</ins>. The servant attempts to grapple an adjacent target. If grappled, a creature cannot breathe. Only one creature can be grappled at a time.

<ins>Wind Blast</ins>. The servant pushes a creature with strong winds. If the target fails a strength save, it is blown nearby, falls prone, and takes damage (x) on impact.

## Random Encounter

Passing through the opening cleans as if taking a perfumed bath, but the next time a trespasser sleeps, they will dream of the adarna song, only waking up 1D6 days later. <br>	&nbsp; OR <br>	**Omen:** You hear a heartbreakingly beautiful bird song, your eyes starts to grow heavy. See *soothing song* ability.
1. **Spoor:** One broken iridescent feather only visible to creatures with more than 5 intelligence.

1. **Trace:** A person (D4 1:Artist, 2:Noble, 3:Child, 4:Ettercap) arrives with legends of the bird. They are escorted by a (D4 1:Veteran Game Hunter, 2:Local Guide, 3:Oneirologist, 4:Pet).

## What the Monster Wants

Evil celestials give the reward and the quest at the same time, then try to make accomplishing the quest impossible within the decided time frame. Good celestials give a quest first and the reward upon completion. The price of breaking a pact is always your soul. 

1. Decorate the place with fresh flowers, only for them to die before the task is complete.
1. To be captured by an impossibly good person.
1. Transition through all the colors.
1. Clean the area completely.
1. Freeze in time a person at its beauty peak.
1. Sing a duet that matches its beauty.

## Salvaging the Body

A quill made of an adarna bird feather is prized by wizards who can use it to scribe a new spell with the word *chromatic*.

Collecting adarna bird guano is hard, but the substance is also powerful and precious. Fresh adarna bird’s guano petrifies sleeping creatures upon contact.
