# Vyderac Swarm

**HD:** 0 +4D4HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderacs do not see well but can smell their pheromones up to a mile away. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 10’ without momentum.

In a swarm, Vyderacs are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spell and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Attach.</ins> The Vyderac swarm makes a melee attack with reach using its HP as its attack stat (1D4). The damage inflicted is the number of Vyderacs attached to the victim (see above), the swarm loses as much HP.
