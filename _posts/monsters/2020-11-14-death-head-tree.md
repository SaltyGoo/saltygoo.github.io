title: Death's Head Tree
---

Parasitic tree with face shaped fruits. A plant.

Imagine a weeping willow but with much thicker branches. It bears head sized fruits that smell like rotting flesh and sporadically have gas leaks that sound like cries. Even more disturbingly, from afar, each fruit looks like the severed head of a humanoid and floats if detached.

**HD:** 6  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** huge <br>
**Stats:** very strong and sturdy, but static and barely conscious<br>
**Movement:** static<br>
**Morale:** mindless <br>

As a plant, the death's head tree cant see, hear, be stunned or dazed. However it detects movement in its vincinity. It's tree compact, moist wood makes it resistant to bludgeoning, piercing and fire damage.

Additionnaly, the death’s head tree has <ins>4D4 heads</ins>. While it has more than one head, it has advantage on saving throws. Whenever the death’s head tree takes 4 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads detaches.

**Attacks (# of heads/round)**

<ins>Kiss.</ins> The death’s head tree makes one melee attack (1). On a hit, the target makes a save vs poison or catches the death’s head parasite.

<ins>Needle.</ins> The death’s head tree makes one ranged attack (1). On a hit, the target makes a save vs poison or catches the death’s head parasite.

<span class="alchemy"> **Death's Head Parasite.** Disease. Symptom: reduces maximum HP by 1D4. Save every night to avoid adding a cumulative symptom. If max HP is 0, gain 1D4 wounds instead.</span>

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Death’s head fruits are not only disgusting, but also diseased. The wood from the tree is supple and dark red, a favorite of vampire artisans. Magic weapons and armors can often be found under the roots of such tree.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The original [death's head tree](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/deaheatr.html) comes from Ravenloft, and like many Ravenloft creatures, it is full of creepy flavour. For this adaptation, I simply streamlined the mechanics.
