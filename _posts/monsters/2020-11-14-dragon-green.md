Means and poisonous forest dragon. A beast.

Imagine a sleek western dragon with a particularly long neck and yellow frills. It loves to lie and manipulate, and it wants as many living humanoids as it can in its hoard.

## Green Dragon Lair

Non-wyrmlings dragons have the following additional attack options when in their lair (using the same dice as their rake/stomp attack):

<ins>Grasping Roots.</ins> Surfaces near a point the dragon can see erupt with grasping plants that attempt to grapple creatures within them. The area becomes difficult terrain after that.

<ins>Thorn Wall.</ins> A 10’-high wall of thorns bursts from the ground between two points. Pushing creatures to the side of the dragon’s choice. Walking through the wall requires a strength check and inflicts damage (1Dx). Each segment of the wall has 10 hit points.

<ins>Sleep Cloud.</ins> One creature within the dragon’s lair must make a saving throw or fall asleep. If the target resists, it is immune for 24h.
