You command blood to serve you. As you cast this spell, make a melee attack with a dagger against a blooded target. You have a [sum] bonus to your attack roll and a bonus of [dice] to your damage.

You create a [dice] HD [Blood Elemental](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/elemental-water) with as many hit points as the damage you inflicted. It will obey your command.
