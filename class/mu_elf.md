## Elven Magic
You can cast spells using Spell Dice (SD) like a Wizard. They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<ins>Casting a Spell</ins><br>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Elf template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). These might end your wizardly career.
</details>

## Burden of Perfection
Hard rolls are normal, and normal rolls are easy as long as you are not ugly, dirty, disfigured, humiliated, etc. Otherwise they are all hard. *You have to beat 15 to succeed a [normal roll](/2020/11/09/base-rules/), 10 to succeed on an easy one, and 20 to succeed on a hard one.*

## Nobless Oblige
Your superiority comes with the moral duty to help inferior people. You always know the plight of humanoid groups you can see. This knowledge is superficial, more akin to a historical footnote.

## True Shot I
When you shoot an arrow, you can cast a spell on the same target, ignoring the normal range of the spell.

## True Shot II
You can use a bow twice during your turn as long as you are not ugly, dirty, disfigured, humiliated, etc.
