[deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com)'s GLOG [conversions](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2022/12/call-me-what-you-will-glog-classes-5e.html) of the 5e fighter subclasses inspired me to look at them again. Having done that, the 5e fighting styles really stuck out to me as afterthoughts: half of them are a little bonus you add on your character sheet and forget about, and the other half are so niche you litteraly forget about them without ever using them. In his conversion, deus did a pretty good job translating them to OSR play, but it highlighted a design problem specific to me: I've avoided +X bonuses in all of my class abilities, except for the per-template bonus, my goal being that the players only have to track one resource per class.



I'm personnnaly pretty happy with my version of the [generic fighter](/class/fighter)

**Nervous Hunter** <br>
_âœ¤ They clearly are the most paranoid of the group._ <br>
You are as tense as your bowstring. When you have your ranged weapon ready, you can interrupt the referee at any moment to shoot whatever they are describing. You have the advantage if you do not know what the target is yet. If you hit an actual danger to you or your friends, you are calmed for the rest of your day.
