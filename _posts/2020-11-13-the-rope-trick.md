R: Touch		D: [dice]*10 minutes

You must have seen magicians throw a rope upwards, only to have the rope become rigid, and then see them climb the rope, seemingly attached nowhere.

Well, the rope is attached somewhere. Somewhere in this case is a nook between dimensions: up to [dice] person can climb up and sit comfortably, twice as much if a lot of discomfort can be tolerated. 

After the caster enters the nook, the spell does not end until the caster leaves. The caster can also pull the rope in the nook.
