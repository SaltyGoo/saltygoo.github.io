# Pallonia, Contemplating Nun
She's sitting on a rock, contemplating the waves. Thin, long teeth, blue eyes. Her nun habits are weathered and too big for her.

*"I know why you're here. It's the same reason everyone else comes to see me, and you shall get the same answer..."*

**The Problem** - There are much bigger, cosmic forces at play than local conflicts between bandits and merchants, and nobody is acting on them. The children of a god is roaming the area, bringing chaos in its wake and nervousness in the heaven!

**Wants** - Acknowledgement of the cosmic disturbance, or alternatively be left alone.

**Hates** - Mundane questions, petty questions, selfish questions. Who cares about harvest seasons, gambling and iron crises?

**Quirk** - She *always* sees things on a bigger scale than you. She never stops contemplating the waves. If you meet her at different locations, you have no idea how she got there.

**Stats** - As a *Diviner*.

*Note: I often find players get obsessed with what is directly in front of them. I use NPCs like that to remind them of the scale of the world. Use Pallonia as a tool to inform the players on how close they are to resolving the intrigue of **Sarevok**, **Imoen** and **Irenicus**.*
