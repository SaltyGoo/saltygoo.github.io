title: Running Call of Chtulhu with Messerspiel rules
---

Normally I'm just a lil glogger doing my lil glogger things without writing about them. But since I've just been doing layout design for the last months, I feel compelled to chat a bit.

My play group will be playing Call of Chtulhu instead of Glog-DnD this summer and I can't wait. Problem is, after having gotten used to the lightness of the GLOG rules, I couldn't go back to the pile of sub-systems that is Call of Chtulhu. [Xenophon of Athens](https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/) on the GLOG discord suggested I look at Messerspiel for inspiration.
