The slow, methodical conversion of more than 9000 monsters from DnD history to the GLoG.

[All monsters](/list/monsters)<br>
[How to read a monster stat block](/monsters/lexicon)

## By Monster Type
I classify monsters in 8 thematic categories with some mechanical common thread, because I love when players can learn:

[Beasts](/list/monsters-beast) — Animals and Plants<br>
[Constructs](/list/monsters-construct) — Machines <br>
[Divine](/list/monsters-celestial) — Angels and Devils <br>
[Elementals](/list/monsters-elemental) — Air, Earth, Fire and Water <br>
[Fairies](/list/monsters-fey) — Magical tricksters <br>
[Horrors](/list/monsters-aberration) — Mutants and Aliens<br>
[Humanoids](/list/monsters-humanoid) — People <br>
[Undeads](/list/monsters-undead) —  Other monsters brought back to life
