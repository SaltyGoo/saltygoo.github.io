Curse-brewing, children-eating crone. A fay.

_Have you ever shielded your broken heart with a cocoon of bitterness? This distorted hunched woman wrapped in dark shawls embodies that. It corrupts souls._

_Hideous inside and out, Thinly-concealed bitterness, Condescendingly familiar._

Night Hags are often seen with _[Flocks of Birds](/monsters/bird)_ and other [Beasts](/list/monsters-beast).

Practicing magic with a wand made of dryad oak might give a wizard the inspiration to create a spell with the word *oak*.
