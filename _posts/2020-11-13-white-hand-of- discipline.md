**D**: 10 minutes

One of your hands becomes as hard and durable as steel. It doesn't become any heavier and deals no extra damage, but it is completely impervious to damage. You can even use it to parry sword blows. It grants +[dice] to your armor. It can pick up anything, manipulate fire, stir acid, etc.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
