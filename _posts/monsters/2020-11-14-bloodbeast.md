*Giant spider leech. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The bloodbeast and the bloodgill are orginal creations of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/11/new-oebx1e-monster-bloodgill_20.html) originaly for his* Starmaster* sci-fi game. It's weird and I love the idea of being sucked dry by a swarm of bipedal tadpoles. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a sand colored leech as long as a horse. It stands high on six long insectoid legs. Its head is framed by vestigal gills.

Always hungry, it is an ambush predator.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 7 / 7 / 8 / 1 / 6 / 2 <br>
**Armor:** as leather <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Bloodbeasts camouflage very well in rocky landscapes. They can jump 30’ without momentum. They dont see much, but sensors on their skin allow them to operate without sight.

**Attacks:** Each round, the bloodbeast can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The bloodbeast makes a melee attack with reach (2x) and grapples the target. As long as a target is grappled, it cannot use its bite attack.

<ins>Drain Blood.</ins> The bloodbeast inflicts both physical and constitution damage (x) to a grappled target as it drains its blood.

# Bloodgill

Bloodsucking bipedal tadpoles. 

Bloodgills are the larval stage of the blood beast. Imagine a rotond spotted leech standing upright on two chubby legs and with fin-like gills sprouting from its flanks.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** tiny &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 2 / 5 / 5 / 1 / 4 / 1  <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1 <br>
**Movement:** slow, swim average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Bloodgills are amphibious and can breath as well in water as outside. They can jump 10’ without momentum. They dont see much, but sensors on their skin allow them to operate without sight.

**Attacks:** Each round, the bloodgill can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The bloodgill makes a melee attack attaches itself to the target. As long as it is attached, it cannot use its bite attack.

<ins>Drain Blood.</ins> The bloodgill inflicts both physical and constitution damage (x) to a target it is attached to as it drains its blood.
