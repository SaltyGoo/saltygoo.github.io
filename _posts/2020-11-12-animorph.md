**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

_All iterations of [animal] should be replaced by a specific animal species when the spell is first found._

You take the form of an [animal] up to your size, including all its natural abilities. You retain your current hit points, attack rolls and saving throws but cannot use any abilities requiring human form such as spell casting.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect lasts 1 day.
