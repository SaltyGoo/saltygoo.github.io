##### A monster originating from Haitian mythology.

**Mindless animated corpses.** Zombies are mindless, shambling, drones. They simply obey the last command of the entity that created them. Sometimes seen led by a [necromancer](/monsters/wizard) or hosting a [centipede swarm](/monsters/donestre). An undead.

_Imagine a dead human. Rotting for who knows how long. Parts of its skin is missing, eaten by maggots. It shambles._

It is **immune** to death. When "killed", it loses a limb and comes back to unlife after 1 turn. The only way to prevent that is if the body is destroyed or blessed.

Zombies rarely hold anything material of value. But their still-animated limbs can be useful for alchemists and wizard. Their blood and entrails carry [zombie plague](/2024/01/01/zombie-plague/), a biological weapon only used by the most immoral creatures.
