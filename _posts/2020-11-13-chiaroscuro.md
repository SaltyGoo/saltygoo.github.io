**R**: [dice] x 30'  **D**: 10 minutes

You divide a space entirely within range in [dice] zones of bright light and [dice] zones of utter darkness. You can control the colours of the lights. Light sources brought into the dark zones do not shine further than 5'.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
