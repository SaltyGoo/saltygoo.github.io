*Arachnomorphosis*

**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You grow spinnerets capable of ejecting a 30’ rope-like strand of spider web. For the duration of the spell, you can do the following actions: 

<ins>Lasso</ins>. Make a ranged attack against a target. On a hit, it is grappled.

<ins>Attach</ins>. Anchor yourself to an adjacent surface with a 5’ to 30’ rope.

<ins>Cocoon</ins>. Take 10 minutes to envelope a still object in a silk cocoon.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
