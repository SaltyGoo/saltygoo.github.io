D: Sigil

When you first gain this spell, roll a D10 to know which of the 10 wards you got: first (acid), second (blunt), third (cold), fourth (electric), fifth (fire), sixth (mind), seventh (magical), ninth (poison) and tenth (slashing). 

You place your Sigil on a creature or an object. It then can absorb up to [sum] + [dice] points of damage of the ward’s type without harm. 

As long as it has absorbed damage, its unarmed strike (if any) inflicts [dice] extra damage of the ward’s type.

At any point during the duration, you can release all the ward’s stored damage, damaging everything within 10’ of it. There’s also 1 out of 6 chance it happens whenever the sigiled thing hits or is hit.

If you know multiple of the 10 wards, you can cast [dice] of them in the same Sigil.
