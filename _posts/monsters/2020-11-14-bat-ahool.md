*Giant clawed bat with a terrifying howl.*

###### Beast. Adapted from [the Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium)

Imagine a wolf’s howl mixed with a human’s scream. That is the sound of the Ahool, a bat with a wingspan larger than you and dark-gray fur. As it moves, you might see light reflect on its razor sharp fangs and claws.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 4 / 8 / 5 / 1 / 6 / 4 <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark. Ahools are exceptionally stealthy.

**Echolocation:** As long as it can hear, the bat can detect invisible creatures.

**Attacks:** Each round, the ahool can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Bite</ins>. The ahool makes a melee attack with disadvantage (2x). 

<ins>Claws</ins>. The ahool makes a melee attack (x). 

<ins>Unsettling Howl</ins>. Each creature that can clearly hear the ahool is deafened and must save or be stunned for 1 turn.

## Salvaging the Body

Ahool fur is dark gray and very good as a camouflage during nighttime. You would still need the skin of two of them to make an outfit. Otherwise, the ahool is comestible if leathery.
