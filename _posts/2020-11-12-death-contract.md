**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You conjure forth a [lesser divine servant](/list/monsters-celestial) and negotiate terms surrounding the death of the target; part of payment is always its soul. Your Sigil must be set upon a possession of the target. For the duration of the spell, the servant will have [sum] temporary hit points and hunt the possessor of the object the Sigil is set upon until the possessor is slain or your Sigil is removed.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, you can conjure a greater divine servant instead.
