**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes 

You ward the area [dice] x 5' around you against prying. Creatures outside the area must save or become physically unable to look at it, even in their peripheral vision.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the floor, the effect becomes permanent in this location.
