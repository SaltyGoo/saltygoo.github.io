---

Wood nymph. A fey.

Have you ever felt a moment of pure peace while resting under the shade of a verdant tree? Imagine this feeling made human. It has soft skin, the color of bark and leaves that match the season instead of hairs.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** agile, wise, obsessed and very charismatic <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairy, the dryad *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the dryad can speak with local plants and animals. It can also dive into any tree to teleport to any other tree in sight. If slain, a dryad is reincarnated on a full moon if its tree is still alive and healthy.

**Non-Combat Magic** <br>
Divination, Enchantment, Druidcraft.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Shillelagh</ins>. The dryad makes a melee attack with an enchanted stick (1D6). On a hit, the target is grappled to the ground.

<ins>Spellcasting (3).</ins> *Entangle, Hypnotic Fragrance, Summon Wildlife, Wall of Thorns.*

<ins>Command Sealife.</ins> One local animal or plant in sight makes a melee attack on a target of the nereid’s choice. It can save to resist.

<ins>Nature's Lure.</ins> The dryad attempts to bewitch one humanoid or beast in sight. On a fail, the target is charmed until it leaves the forest. The charm breaks if the dryad or its allies attack the charmed person. A creature who succeeds its save is immune to this dryad’s charm forever.

Dryads usually do not carry much and, once killed, it and all the nearby plants immediately dry into wooden husks. Its oak, however, provides the most supple yet sturdy wood and often hides the precious belongings of all its charmed victims.

Practicing magic with a wand made of dryad oak might give a wizard the inspiration to create a spell with the word *oak*.
