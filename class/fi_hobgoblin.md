###### A monster class for the [Hobgoblin](/monsters/hobgoblin), the more intelligent and vicious cousins of the goblins. Illustrator unknown.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Leather Breastplate, a Weapon of your choice, and choose one of a 10' Chain, two crappy Shivs (1D4 damage), or a Stink Bomb

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Wolf Rider, Legionnaire, Dumpyard Bully, or Goblin Slaver

For every Hobgoblin template you have, you can gain one extra _Goblin Minion_.

**A:** Goblin Minions, Taller Goblin<br>
**B:** Bad Leadership, Bugbeardom<br>
**C:** Goblin Career<br>
**D:** Goblin Legion<br>

## Goblin Minions
You have a knack for finding goblins to serve you wherever you are. Each goblin you have can carry one object at a time, and weapons they use can't inflict more than 1D4 damage. They will obey your orders blindly but are completely unskilled except for stabbing. They have 1 HP.

You can have as many minions at a time as you have _Hobgoblin templates_ and they dont count towards your follower limit. You can find _one_ new goblin when you wake up from a rest and replace one who died.

## Taller Goblin
You are still a goblin. You and your goblins can see in the dark as if you were carrying torches.

## Bad Leadership
You can gruesomely kill one of your minions to halve incoming damage, or to [frighten](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) a humanoid.

## Bugbeardom
When one of your goblins kills an enemy, it becomes bigger and meaner. Name it. Its maximum damage increases by 1 dice size and it gains 3HP. Cumulative.

## Goblin Career
Depending on your starting skill, you gain the following benefits :

- **Wolf Rider :** You gain a [wolf](/monsters/boar) [follower](/2020/11/09/base-rules/). It is big enough to be your mount and knows 4 one-word commands. You can train it as you would any other beast.
- **Legionnaire :** You inflict bonus damage equal to the number of goblin minions surrounding your target.
- **Dumpyard Bully :** Your minions can be said to have any generic tool that could plausibly be found in a scrapyard. The tool breaks and the minion dies upon usage.
- **Goblin Slaver :** You can sell your minions for the equivalent of a [bag of silver coins](/2024/06/26/currency/).

## Goblin Legion
You can now find up to 4 replacement goblins each time you rest.

Minions fear you enough to be able to help you on any task. One of them can help you on any roll you do. When you choose to, add 1D4 to the roll's result. If the result of the D4 is 3 or 4, the goblin dies pathetically while helping you.

Your goblins can even be used as actual D4 [Spell Dice](/class/wizard#spells) if you find a spell book. If you do so, for each die roll of 3 or 4, one goblin explodes and you take 2 points of damage. The spellâ€™s effects are reflavored as goblins acting it.
