title: Pack Neatly
---
R: 30'

Objects within a [dice x 5'] cube are packed neatly. You must name the objects or their general category when you cast the spell ("those coins", "the contents of that room") If no packing materials are provided, the objects will be stacked into compact cubes, with the largest and most stable objects at the bottom. If chests, paper and twine, sacks, carts, etc. are provided, the spell will use them as you direct. The packages created will take up the minimum space possible, and will be remarkably sturdy. The objects must be able to move freely. You cannot use this spells to pack clothes someone is wearing. The objects will not be lifted more than 10' off the ground during the packing process.
