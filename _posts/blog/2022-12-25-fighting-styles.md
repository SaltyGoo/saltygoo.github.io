[deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com)'s GLOG revision of the much hated [5e fighter subclasses](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2022/12/call-me-what-you-will-glog-classes-5e.html) sparked a lot of discussions on discord about the (lack of) flavour and vision in the original designs. How do you make them interesting beyond bland combat bonuses? I got stuck on the 5e fighting styles because I feel they have the potential to add a lot of character, but also because it was a challenge to fit into Salty Goo: there are no +X bonus in my GLOG outside of the one each class gets per level.



I'm personnnaly pretty happy with my version of the [generic fighter](/class/fighter)

**Nervous Hunter** <br>
_âœ¤ They clearly are the most paranoid of the group._ <br>
You are as tense as your bowstring. When you have your ranged weapon ready, you can interrupt the referee at any moment to shoot whatever they are describing. You have the advantage if you do not know what the target is yet. If you hit an actual danger to you or your friends, you are calmed for the rest of your day.
