title: Mephit, Ooze
---

Earth and water animated by a spark of mischief. Elemental earth and water.

Imagine if a little grotesque gargoyle was made of ever dripping mud.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** sturdy yet dumb <br>
**Movement:** average, swim average, fly average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As elemental earth and water, the ooze mephit *resists all damage*. It *recovers 1 HP* every round spent in mud or ooze and *loses 1 HP* each round spent not touching it. It has the same properties as mud and can squeeze through holes as small as 1 inch.

Additionally, when the ooze mephit dies, it explodes in a small burst of ooze which not only permanently stains clothes, but make everybody caught in the blast poisoned from the stench for 10 minutes.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Spit Ooze</ins>. The mephit makes a-ranged attack against a target. On a hit, roll a D6, that body part is glued: 1) mouth ([cant breathe](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions)); 2) a leg (cant move); 3) an arm (stuck to an adjacent surface or creature); 4) eyes (blinded).

<ins>Sticky Hands</ins>. The mephit makes a grapple attempt with advantage. On a roll of 20, it enters the mouth of its target, choking it from the inside. Drinking a lot or making yourself vomit allows a CON save to expulse it. Alcohol gives you advantage.
