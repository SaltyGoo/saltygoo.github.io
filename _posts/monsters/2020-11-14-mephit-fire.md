Imagine if a little grotesque gargoyle was made of pure flames.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile yet dumb <br>
**Movement:** average fly fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As elemental fire, the fire mephit *resists all damage* and is *immune to fire*. It *recovers 1 HP* every round spent ablaze or with fuel and *loses 1 HP* each round spent without fuel. Contact with it inflicts 1 fire damage. It has the same properties as fire.

Additionally, when the fire mephit dies, it explodes in a small burst of flame inflicting 1D4 damage to all adjacent creatures and setting objects ablaze.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Spit Fire</ins>. The mephit makes a ranged attack against two adjacent targets (1) and sets them ablaze.

<ins>Claw</ins>. The mephit makes a melee attack (1) and sets the target ablaze.
