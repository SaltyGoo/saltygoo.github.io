*Fear-devouring tumors with your face. Aberration.*

<span class="alchemy"> *I think the abysmal is an orginal creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). When adapting it, I wanted to up the horror factor and was inspired by Junji Ito's short story "The Hanging Balloons" found in "The Face Burglar / 顔泥棒". — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a humanoid face bloated like a balloon, with eight clawed arms below the neck instead of a body. It eats fear and is born from fleshy tumors that grow in areas touched by weird energy. <br>

<img src="/images/Abysmal.png" alt="Abysmal"  width="250" style="border:5px solid black">

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 6 / 8 / 3 / 5 / 7  <br>
**Resistances:** mind <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The abysmal sees in in the dark and smells fear. 

**Aberration:** To kill an aberration, one must succeed on a save vs. fear. On a failure, it survives with 1 HP.

**Visage of Terror:** If the abysmal glances at you, the abysmal’s face becomes a distorted version of yours, and you must make a saving throw against fear. On a failure, you are frightened. On a success you are immune to this abysmal’s visage for 1 hour. 

When the abysmal has your face copied, slicing your own face or denying its existence (and losing 1D4 wisdom) kills it. It will come back in one hour.

**Attacks:** Each round, the abysmal can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The abysmal makes one melee attack (x). If the target is frightened, the attack is made with advantage and the abysmal is healed by the damage inflicted.

<ins>Claw.</ins> The abysmal makes two melee attacks (x).

<ins>Silent Shout.</ins> Roll 1D6 for each frightened creatures within sight of the abysmal. For each 1 rolled, a new abysmal is summoned. They will arrive in 1D4 turns.
