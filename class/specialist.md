Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html).

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your failed career. Stealth.

For every Specialist template you have, increase your Stealth by 1.

**A:** Wall Crawler, Scrounge <br>
**B:** Pick 1 trick, Roll 1 trick <br>
**C:** Roll 2 tricks <br>
**D:** Pick 1 trick, Roll 1 trick <br>

## Wall Crawler
You climb just as well without climbing gear as with it. If a climb would be trivial using gear, you don’t need to roll, even if you’re free-climbing. If a climb would be impossible using gear, you can roll anyway.

## Scrounge
Once per session, digging through trash, you can get an item rolled on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) table.

# 1D20 Tricks

**Acrobat:** You have +2 movement. Treat your falls as 20’ shorter. You can easily maintain your balance on a taut rope. 

**Cat’s Eyes:** You can see nearby in darkness (no color). 

**Coward:** Cover grants +2 armor.

**Divine Grunt:** 1/day, issue an irresistible one-word command. Only affects: D4 1 Undead, 2 Animals, 3 Plants, 4 Furniture

**Dog Whisperer:** You have a dog. Dogs you train have advantage on stealth, communicate if an area is obviously dangerous, and track a week-old trail by scent without fail (barring magical concealment). 

**Fashionable:** Fancy clothes provide +1 armor and don’t take up any inventory slots. 

**Getaway Horse:** You have a horse. Horses you train have advantage on stealth, understand abstract directions, and follow a schedule to the minute.

**Lucky:** 1/day, reroll one of your D20 rolls. 

**Opportunist:** When you have advantage on attack, deal an extra 1D6 damage. 

**Pack Rat:** +3 inventory slots. 

**Quick Fingers:** You have advantage on rolls to pickpocket people. You can steal things directly out of someone’s hands with a regular (no advantage) dexterity save. 

**Recorder Crow:** You have a crow. It can make and play auditory recordings. It responds to Record, Stop Recording, Play, Pause, Rewind, and Fast Forward. Max storage: 1 hour. It’s very smart. 

**Redirect:** If your dodge roll was 5 points or more bigger than an enemy's attack roll, you can redirect the attack to an adjacent creature. 

**Second Chance:** Once per lifetime, cheat death. 

**Square Meal:** Lunch heals you 1 Wound provided you pair it with alcohol. 

**Tongues:** 1/day Speak with D4: 1 Weapons, 2 Doors, 3 Birds, 4 Clothing

**Tricky:** Whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 on an attack roll, you can attempt a combat maneuvre on top of the damage.

**Urchin:** A street rat demands to learn. They’re a very sneaky hireling that doesn’t ask for pay. If you lose your urchin, you can recruit another wherever urchins are plentiful, but it will be difficult if you have a reputation for getting them killed. 

**Watchful:** You have advantage on initiative. You can’t be snuck past. 

**Wizardly Initiate**: By tasting an object, you can tell whether or not it is magical. You have 1 Spell Dice that regenerates overnight. (You can’t learn spells but can use scrolls).
