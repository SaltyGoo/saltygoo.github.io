title: Fighting Styles
---

This is my interpretation of all 5e fighting styles, inspired by [deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com)'s [conversions](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2022/12/call-me-what-you-will-glog-classes-5e.html) of the 5e fighter. DnD fighting styles represent everything I'm trying not to do in Salty Goo, but they also have the very allluring potential to give ~style~ to a character. Like, their names evoke bigger, cooler things than what their mechanical effects do, if it makes sense.

I started my conversion like a design exercise (no +X bonuses, more narrative), without knowing if the end result would be useful. Along the way, I started seeing them as tropes, hence the new names, and thought of maybe giving them as boons to my players when their characters are fleshed out trough play. I put the criterias I had in mind for that in italic with a ✤. Now that I'm done and pretty happy about them, I've made them a feature of my [generic fighter](/class/fighter).

**Nervous Hunter** <br>
_✤ Clearly the most paranoid of the group._ <br>
You are as tense as your bowstring. When you have your ranged weapon ready, you can interrupt the referee at any moment to shoot whatever they are describing. You have the advantage if you do not know what the target is yet. If you hit an actual danger to you or your friends, you are calmed for the rest of your day.

<br>

**Focused Loner** <br>
_✤ Spends time split from the group._ <br>
Hush! Take a deep breath. When you close your eyes and don't speak, you can ~feel~ the presence of any other creature in the room with you (or looking at you if outdoors). When you do so, you can interact with any adjacent being as if you could see them. 

<br>

**Daring Swashbuckler** <br>
_✤ They love flashy, overcomplicated plans._ <br>
Your dashing exploits have earned you a new nickname in the area. Choose it. You can now make a combat maneuver AND use a ranged weapon on your turn. Doing so increases your nickname’s fame.
