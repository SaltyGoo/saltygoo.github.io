**R**: Touch  **D**: [dice] x 10 minute

You petition sand to welcome you and your allies in its midst. You can charm as much sand as to contain [dice] humans at a time. For the duration of the spell, you and your allies can breath in the charmed sand and swim in it like it was water, and, as long as you are partly submerged in it, you can detect the vibrations caused by other objects and creatuers touching it.

If you cast this spell with 4 [dice] against a single target and inscribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect is permanent.
