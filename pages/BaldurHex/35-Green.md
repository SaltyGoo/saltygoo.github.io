<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Carnival</span>

The winter carnival of Nashkel starts as soon as the autumn equinox passes until the next full moon. Entertainers from all the southern sword coast gather here. Among the tents you can find:

- **Gambling Tents.** Two big tents are set up with card games, roulette, dart throwing and a lot of alcohol.
- **Alchemist Brews.** The alchemist here is a known scammer. However, if you can filter through the overpriced snake oil, you will find some rare brew.
- **Exotic Weapons Shop.** The merchant here sells an exclectic assortment of weird nonmagical weapons. He will also identify those you find.
- **Bower and Target Game.** This stand sells novelty arrows, and even some magical ones if you can shoot three bottles in three shots.
- **Trinket Store.** An old lady sells amulets and arcane trinkets.
- **Novelty Tailor.** Garish clothes and armor pieces are found in this tent.
- **Circus.** Hay bleachers surround this patch of dirt where performances happen all day. Most famously The Amazing Oompah, the explosive ogre.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Cart Village</span>

A dozen of carts and as many horses are stationed in a circle in a clearing not far from the carnival. This is where the merchants and performers from the carnival live. The walls are thin, though, and you can hear many secrets.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Lotus Tent</span>

Hidden in the forest near the Carnival is a single tent littered with colourful pillows and water pipes. This "sleeping tent" is for people who want to partake in black lotus.
