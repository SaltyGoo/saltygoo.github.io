Fiery lizard people. A fire elemental.

_Imagine a salamander standing on its rear legs, seven feet tall. Its wet red and black skin is glowing like magma and its eyes are like black pearls._

_Proud soldier, Relaxing artist, Arrogant explorer._

It is **immune** to fire. 
It **resists** all other damage (because it's an elemental).
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round it touches something flammable and inflicts 1 damage to anything that touches or damages it in melee.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent without fuel.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Skewer</ins>. The salamander makes a melee attack with reach (1D6 +1 fire damage).

<ins>Scalding Tongue</ins>. The salamander makes a [grappling](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) attack with reach, burning its target (1D4) and dragging it to itself.

<summary>Conjuring the Elemental</summary>

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such a way for a minimum of 2 Spell Dice:

**Conjure Salamander** <br>
R: 30'â€ƒ

The spell is identical to the normal conjure spell, except that you can add treasures as offerings to the Shah to improve the spell. Each treasure either adds 2 salamanders or increases the duration by 24 hours. If you bring the salamander to their death (in an suicidal fight for example), the Shah will be offended and never trade with you again.
