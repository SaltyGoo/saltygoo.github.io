*Air elemental specialized in abductions.*

###### Elemental. Adapted from [AD&D 2e](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elekaase.html)

Imagine a nearly invisible, legless humanoid made of sparkling blue smoke. They are most often bound to a mission to capture a prey when met, but would love to kill their summoner even more. 

When free, they serve as messengers  between gods.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 10 / 7 / 3 / 5 / 3 <br>
**Immunities:** electricity, grapple, petrification, sleep <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The aerial servant loses all resistances if it is prone or cant move.

As a gaseous creature, it can fit into any hole. It always knows the exact location of its target if it is clearly identified.

**Attacks:** Each round, the aerial servant can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Crush</ins>. The aerial servant makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Ethereal Shift</ins>. The servant shifts between the ethereal and physical worlds. It is visible in either, but cant affect or be affected by anything in the plane it isn’t. 

<ins>Smother</ins>. The servant attempts to grapple an adjacent target. If grappled, a creature cannot breathe. Only one creature can be grappled at a time.

<ins>Wind Blast</ins>. The servant pushes a creature with strong winds. If the target fails a strength save, it is blown nearby, falls prone, and takes damage (x) on impact.

## Binding the Elemental

You gain a [Spell Dice](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells), one Doom Point and ...

1. ... your lungs are crushed, giving you a permanent level of fatigue.
1. ... you are transported into the ether.
1. ... all air elementals suddenly knows your exact location. 
1. ... you can see the ethereal border.
1. ... you hover.
1. ... the spell word *Capture*.

If you roll a catastrophe, the elemental is released.

## Conjuring an Aerial Servant

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 4 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Aerial Servant**
R: 20’ D: [dice] days

The summon has one task only: retrieve the person or object you want dead or alive after which it is banished back to the plane of air. It is bound to complete this task as fast as possible, but will try to kill you along the way if it doesn’t slow it down.
