Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html).

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your failed career. Stealth.

For every Specialist template you have, increase your Stealth by 1.

**A:** Wall Crawler, Scrounge <br>
**B:** Pick 1 trick, Roll 1 trick <br>
**C:** Roll 2 tricks <br>
**D:** Pick 1 trick, Roll 1 trick <br>

## Wall Crawler
You climb just as well without climbing gear as with it. If a climb would be trivial using gear, you don’t need to roll, even if you’re free-climbing. If a climb would be impossible using gear, you can roll anyway.

## Scrounge
Once per session, digging through trash, you can get an item rolled on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) table.
