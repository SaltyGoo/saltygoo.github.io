**R**: Touch		**D**: [sum] hours

You must brew up a mix of milk and honey (and other things) before casting this spell, which, if drank warm, puts the drinker to sleep for [sum] hours. All attempts to awake the drinker short of damaging it will be fruitless, but they will wake up at maximum HP and will have recovered from [dice] diseases and/or poisons.
