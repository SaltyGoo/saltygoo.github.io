title: Circle of Sand
---
**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You regulate the temperature in an area. You take 10 minutes to trace a circle in sand and complete it with your Sigil. The circle can be up to [dice] x 20' wide. Once it is done, the temperature inside the circle changes by [sum] x 5 degrees celsius, up or down.

Every 30 degrees below zero inflicts 1D6 cold damage per hour, while every 30 degrees above 40 inflicts 1D6 fire damage. Water freezes at 0 and boils at 100.
