<img align="right" width=200px src="/images/AbyssaWretch.png">

Terminally mutated humanoid. An aberration.

_Imagine a humanoid so mutated and corrupted that it looks like it's constantly melting. It has no feelings, only maddening pain._

_Feral from pain, disgustingly resilient, hates life._

| **HD:** 1 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** slow     |   | 

It **resists** mind attacks (because it's an aberration).
It **can't** die unless it's would-be killer saves vs fear.
**Also**, its constant mutating allows it to *heal all its hit points* at the beginning of its turn if it is not dead.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite and Claws.</ins> The wretch makes a melee attack (1D4).

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Abyssal wretches from [Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes](https://5e.tools/book.html#mtf) bring to DnD the trope of the demon-infected mutant-zombies which have been popular in Sci-Fi video games since at least Doom. I wanted to make them different from the undead zombies by giving them extreme regeneration. I added the hulk variant as an homage to my favorite spin on the mutant-zombie trope: Halo's [Flood Carrier](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Flood_Carrier_Form). â€” SaltyGoo
