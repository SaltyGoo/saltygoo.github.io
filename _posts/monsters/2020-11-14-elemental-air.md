Sentient wind. An air elemental.

Imagine wind moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in hisses and temperature changes.

**HD:** X  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** any <br>
**Stats:** agile, strong and indecisive <br>
**Movement:** fly fast<br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As elemental air, the air elemental *resists all damage* and is immune to electricity. It *recovers X HP* every round spent only flying and *takes 1D4* damage each round spent not moving.

As a gaseous creature, the air elemental cant be petrified or grappled, hit by mundane weapons and can fit into any hole. However, winds can hurt it like a sword. Additionally, the air elemental can shape air at will.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Gust</ins>. The elemental pushes an adjacent creature. If it fails a save, it is blown away nearby, falls prone, and takes damage (XD4) on impact.

<ins>Vortex</ins>. The elemental sucks all surrounding objects in. If they fail a save, each adjacent creature has the first 1D4 objects of their inventory stolen.

<ins>Create Wind</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates wind in 20' cube which lasts X minutes. In that zone, moving is harder and missiles inflict half damage.
