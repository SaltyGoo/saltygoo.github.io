D: 10 minutes

You conjure [sum] floating lit candles around you. Each behaves as any regular candle, except they cannot be put out and will burn even underwater. They may also be easily attached to any solid surface. The candles disappear as the spell expires unless they are stuck on a immobile surface, in which case they last 1 hour.
