**R**: 30’ 		**D**: [sum] minutes

For the duration of this spell, anyone that meets your gaze must make a saving throw. Those that fail become fascinated and are unable to act as long as you maintain eye contact and do not do anything other than speaking. 

The subject will answer [dice] basic yes or no questions truthfully, though questions requiring more complicated answers will not be understood, and memories of the episode remain foggy and indistinct.
