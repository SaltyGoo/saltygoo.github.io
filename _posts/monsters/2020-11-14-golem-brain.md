<img align="right" width=250px src="/images/BrainGolem.png">

Animated brain automaton with destructive psychic powers. A construct.

Imagine gray matter molded in an rough humanoid shape, towering at 8 feet tall. It’s held together by an inch deep layer of gelatinous translucent ooze. Being close gives you a headache.

**HD:** 5  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** very strong and sturdy, limited genius intellect <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As a construct, the Brain Golem can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue and fear*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, the Brain Golem is *resistant to mind and magic* and can detect all creatures nearby with an intelligence of 2 or higher even through walls.

This type of golem is extremely intelligent, but its scope is limited to one one-sentence order at a time. Its powerfull numbing psychic aura causes creatures near it to only be able to do either an action OR move on their turn.

The golem’s activation glyph is hidden on among brain folds. If specifically destroyed, the golem is deactivated. It can be altered to change its order. Roll a D12 for its location:

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
This is a streamlining of Arnold K's amazing take on the [golem](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/golems.html). Traditionally, stone golems have a slow ability, which never made sense to me, so I added a shockwave that allows it to prevent unsuspecting adventurers from running away. — SaltyGoo
