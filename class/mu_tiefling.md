<summary>How GLOG spells and doom work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Tiefling template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

## Eugnot
Drawkcab kaeps nac uoy. When you do, celestial and infernal creatures can perfectly understand you, as well as people consumed by a sin.

## Sign of the Devil
People who break the church's rules risk attracting the attention of a devil. The children of the worst of them become marked as spawns of the Devil. Each time you take a Tiefling template, your parent's wickedness become more apparent. Choose one of the sins. You gain the first of its marks. You can take the next mark or choose another sin the next time you gain this ability.

## Consume Soul
Hearts are like cocaine to you. When you eat a fresh heart, you gain advantage on any roll as long as it is for a selfish, cocky and petty action for the next hour. For the following hour, you have disadvantage on all rolls that are not for  a selfish, cocky and petty action.

## Cambion
You have truly become a scion of Hell. Mortals will cower before your power. You gain wings and can fly as fast as you would run.
