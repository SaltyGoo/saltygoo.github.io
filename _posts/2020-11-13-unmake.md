**R**: 30'

You uncreate something made by magic. At 1 or 2 dice, the thing must have been created or conjured up to [sum] rounds ago, at 3+ dice, there is no time limit. If it's an object or spell effect, it vanishes. If it's a creature created by magic, it dies if it fails a save. No effect on creatures conjured from other places or planes though.

If you invest 4 or more dice in this spell, a creature is not allowed a save.
