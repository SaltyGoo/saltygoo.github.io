<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Candlekeep</span>

Nestled atop the cliffs that rise from the Sword Coast, the citadel of Candlekeep houses the finest and most comprehensive collection of writings on the face of Faerûn. It is an imposing fortress, kept in strict isolation from the intrigues that occasionally plague the rest of the Forgotten Realms.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Diplomat's Cove</span>

Hidden below Candlekeep between two high cliffs, this sandy beach is used by dignitaries arriving to the monastery by boat. From there, a guarded tunnel leads directly to the castle.

##### Not in Baldur's Gate but lore accurate!

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Basilisk Cave</span>

Only accessible at low tide. This half-flooded cave network is infested by basilisks and the petrified bodies of adventurers trying to loot Candlekeep's crypts.
