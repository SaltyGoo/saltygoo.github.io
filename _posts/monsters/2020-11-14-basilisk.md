title: Basilisk

##### Mythtical monster originating from Ancient Greece. This version is inspired by the one in [the Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-tomb-of-serpent-kings-megapost.html).

**A lumbering reptile with a petrifying gaze.** Basilisks are not aware of their power and eat whatever they petrify. Sometimes seen herded by _[gravel mephits](/monsters/mephit-earth)_. A large opportunistic beast.

_Imagine a large eight-legged lizard with a spine of quills and a square pupil._

It **cannot** see very well, but it **can** smell very well with its tongue. 

Each round, the basilisk focuses its **gaze** on a creature. The target’s limbs become heavy, slow, and gray. They must save or be functionally [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). This effect ends immediately if the basilisk looks away. If the basilisk stares at the same target for a second round, they must save again or be [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). If they pass, they are still rooted in place (as above). The effect has a short range.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Venomous Bite</ins>. The basilisk makes a melee attack (1D6 dmg) against a target it is focusing on. A [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) target takes extra poison damage (1D6) on a hit, and a [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) one, 2D6.

<ins>Tail Swipe</ins>. The basilisks focuses its gaze on a target while making a melee attack against another target with its tail (1D8 dmg).

<ins>Trash</ins>. Each adjacent creature must dodge or take damage (1D6) and be knocked [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 5 bags of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Basilisk meat is toxic, but its leather is sturdy, its [venom](/2024/01/01/basilisk-venom/) deadly, and its [eyes](/2024/01/01/basilisk-eye/) are connected to the plane of earth. A basilisk can be trained from birth to be a mount.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
