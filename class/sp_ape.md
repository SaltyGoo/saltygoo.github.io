<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A _Sturdy Branch_ (as a Maul), and your choice of _Fire Ants in a Gourd_, a _80' long vine_ or a _Leaf cloak_ (For camouflage). 

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Jungle Life, Mountain Life, Monastery Life, or University Professor (choose a course)

For every Great Ape template you have, you gain 1 **[Psyche](/2020/11/09/base-rules/)** slot.

**A:** Wise, Free<br>
**B:** Unbothered, Strong<br>
**C:** Sapient, Savage<br>
**D:** Enlightened<br>

## Wise
You can take 10 minutes to **Ponder**. When you do, you can do one of the following things:

- Add a simple question about something you can see in your Psyche. The question must be in this format: "Is this (noun) (adjective)?" i.e.: _Is this pathway safe? Is this person kind? Is this king alive?_
- Ask the referee one of the questions in your Psyche. They will reply truthfully.

You must stand still and not be interrupted to ponder.

## Free
You can run on any vertical surface up to 30'.

You can also jump as far as you are higher than your destination. Which means that if you jump somewhere 60' below you, you can also land 60' away from you. You only take 1 damage from every 10' of falling and, if you successfully land on an enemy, it takes 1D6 points of damage per 10' you have fallen from.

## Unbothered
You are immune to pain, hunger and dying while you **Ponder**. You still take damage.

## Strong
If you [grapple](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) something human-sized or smaller, your movement is not hindered by it and you can throw it as easily as you would throw a simple fruit.

## Sapient
Pondering can be done as fast as 1 round and as slow as 100 years, but you must decide beforehand. You can do 2 actions the turn after having pondered.

## Savage
When you grapple a human-sized or smaller target, it also takes 1D6 damage. If a target is already grappled by you on your turn, you can make a Strength save to break whatever limb you are grappling, making it unusable.

<summary>Grappled Condition Reminder</summary>
<i>You cannot move. Roll a D6: 1) your head/mouth/throat is stuck, you canâ€™t breathe; 2) left leg; 3) right leg; 4) left arm; 5) right arm; 6) an item you wear or hold is stuck.</i>
</details>

## Enlightened
When you **Ponder**, you can choose the following option instead:
- Transform one of your questions into an affirmation like "This (noun) is (adjective)". i.e. _This pathway is safe. This person is kind. This king is alive_. When you do so, you must refer to a specific thing you can see. What you change will be undone if you ever stop seeing it.

If you do so, the original question is removed from your Psyche. If your target has a specific _name_, it, or one of its custodians, can use a similar ability using the strucre "this ape is (adjective)" once they become aware of what happened.
