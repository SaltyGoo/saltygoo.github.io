Your choice of Zoology, Local Teenager, or Weird Hermit.

For every Animorph template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and an **[Animorphosis Spell](/spells/#animorphosis)**.

**A:** Animorphosis Spells, Bestiary, Honorary Beast<br>
**B:** Chimera <br>
**C:** Chimera II <br>
**D:** Apotheosis <br>

## Animorphosis Spells
Animorphs get the [animorph spell](/2020/11/12/animorph/) for free at level 1. Their spells are stored in their Bestiary and you spend Spell Dice to cast them. All iterations of [animal] in a spell description should be replaced by a specific animal species when the spell is first found.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Animorph template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).
</details>

Because Animorphs are specialists, when they cast a spell with the keyword [animal], they retrieve their SD on rolls of 1 to 4.

## Bestiary
If you observe an animal for 10 minutes, you can add its species to your Bestiary. You can change any instance of [animal] in a spell description with any species in your Bestiary when you cast a spell.

## Honorary Beast
You can talk to animal species that are noted in your Bestiary. They will not attack you unless provoked.

## Chimera
You can change any instance of [animal] in a spell description with any two species in your Bestiary when you cast a spell. The mix gains the features you want from either animal and the size of one.

## Chimera II
You can change any instance of [animal] in a spell description with any three species in your Bestiary when you cast a spell. The mix gains the features you want from any of them and the size of one.

## Apotheosis
You don't have any real form anymore. Add your birth species to your Bestiary. You decide each time you rest which species from your Bestiary you will be when you wake up.

If you would take damage that would bring you below 0 HP, you can _forever_ remove your current species from your Bestiary instead and transform into another one. When you do, you become prone and with 1 HP. The removed species can never be put into your Bestiary again.
