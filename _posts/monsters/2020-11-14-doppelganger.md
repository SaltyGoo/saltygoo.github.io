title: Doppelganger
---

Ultimate shapeshifter. An aberration.

Imagine a humanoid with no definite features, not even a face. As you look, its fingers stretch into needle like claws.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** weirdly agile, professionally charismatic, wickedly intelligent <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As an aberration, the doppelganger *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally they can read surface nearby surface thoughts not behind tinfoil, making them very hard to hit or surprise. It sees in the dark and is exremely good at lying.

The definitive trait of the doppelganger is its ability to change appearance at will instantaneously.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Murder.</ins> The doppelganger makes a melee attack (1D6) with advantage against a target who doesnâ€™t expect it. On a hit, the target takes a wound.

<ins>Knife Fingers.</ins> The doppelganger makes two melee attacks (1D6).

<ins>Whip Arm.</ins> The doppelganger makes a melee attacks with reach (1D6). On a hit the target is grappled and cant breath.

<ins>Stretch.</ins> The doppelganger attaches itself to a large or bigger surface nearby of it and is dragged to its location. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Having played Baldur's Gate a countless time, I have a particular fondness for the doppelganger. I do, however, find that a creature that can change appearance at will should have more weird attacks.
