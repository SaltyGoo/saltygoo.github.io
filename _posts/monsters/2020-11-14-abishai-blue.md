<summary>DM Notes</summary>
I love devils, I'd even say they are my favourite type of monsters to run. I was always confused with how DnD cosmology had devils that plotted against the gods, good aligned celestials serving the gods and evil gods that were served by ... random evil monsters ? I prefer my gods to be assholes trying to maintain the status quo with arbitrary rules and devils to be the ones who punish those who disobey. Being creatures of order, each devil has a clear behaviour they punish. Adapted from [Mordenkainen's Tome of Foe](https://5e.tools/book.html#mtf) — SaltyGoo
