title: Doppelganger
---

Ultimate shapeshifter. An aberration.

_Imagine a humanoid with no definite features, not even a face. As you look, its fingers stretch into needle-like claws._

_Weirdly agile, professionally charismatic, wickedly intelligent._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 2 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal     |   | 

It **resists** mind attacks (because it's an aberration).
It **can** see in the dark, lie extremely well and read nearby surface thoughts not behind tinfoil, making them very hard to hit or surprise.
It **can't** die unless it's would-be killer saves vs fear.  

The definitive trait of the doppelganger is its ability to change appearance at will instantaneously.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Murder.</ins> The doppelganger makes a melee attack (1D6) with advantage against a target who doesnâ€™t expect it. On a hit, the target takes a [wound](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).

<ins>Knife Fingers.</ins> The doppelganger makes two melee attacks (1D4).

<ins>Whip Arm.</ins> The doppelganger makes a melee attack with reach (1D6). On a hit the target is [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and [can't breathe](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Stretch.</ins> The doppelganger attaches itself to a large or bigger surface nearby and is dragged to its location.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Having played Baldur's Gate countless times, I have a particular fondness for the doppelganger. I do, however, find that a creature that can change appearance at will should have more weird attacks.
