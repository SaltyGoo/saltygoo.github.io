title: Sigil of Zagzagel
---

You summon Zagzagel the Ophanim. A long-limbed woman wreathed in bright fire and fragrant smoke. Her skin is all the colours of sunset. She is clad in burning leaves and branches, and nothing else. Her long hair also burns, and her halo is fire. She carries a shining, reflective disk of gold. Talkative and curious.

Zagzagel will show you a vision of the future which will happen if our course remains the same, answering [dice] questions in a visual form. 

Zagzagel will totally burn up and destroy [dice] slots of cursed, demonic, haunted, or vile items presented to her. 

Zagzagel will make you immune to mundane fire for [dice] days. 

Zagzagel will give you [dice] [doom points](/list/spell-catastrophe) if youâ€™ve ever hurt or killed an animal without good reason. The only good reason, in her eyes, is if it was that or die of starvation.
