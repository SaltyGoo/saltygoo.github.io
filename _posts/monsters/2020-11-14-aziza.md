*Friendly underbush fruit fairy people. Fey.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The aziza, according to Beninese mythology, are small friendly fairies living in anthills. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) is what inspired me. I gave them my typical fey resistances, a fire spell (as they are said to have given the knowledge of fire to humans) and adapted their luck gift ability into a more gonzo drug-themed equivalent. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a leafy, child-like, hairy creature with beady eyes. It dresses in leave cloaks.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 4 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 7 / 7 <br>
**Resistances:** weapons, magic <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

**Spellcasting:** *Charm Animal, Create Bonfire, Detect Evil, Druidcraft, Goodberry, Protection from Evil, Stick to Snake*

Aziza (singular and plural) can speak with all animals and plants. In a lush forest, a careful aziza is very hard to spot. They can see in the dark and often ride animals.

**Attacks:**  Each round, the aziza can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Shillelagh</ins>. The aziza makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Snort Luck Powder</ins> (1/day). The aziza cant get  below 1 hit point for 10 minute, or until it rolls a 20 or a pair.

## Salvaging the Body

You find a stick and ...(Roll as many times as the HD of the monster)

1. Nothing.
1. A fresh fruit.
1. A tiny blowgun.
1. A tiny leaf cloak.
1. A face-fruit.
1. A pouch of luck powder.

Powder Luck is made by grinding face-fruits which are grown from the bodies of humanoids. 

Eating an aziza feeds for a day and provides the effects of a greater restoration spell. It also makes all animals from the area permanently dislike you. The slight buzz might gives a wizard the inspiration to create a spell with the word *Fruit*.

<span class="alchemy">**Luck Powder.** For 10 minutes, you cannot roll below 10. For a session after your first snort, you must carry an aziza on your shoulder (taking an inventory slot). You get two azizas after your second snort, etc. You and fairies are the only only ones who can see or hear them. They are chatty.</span>
