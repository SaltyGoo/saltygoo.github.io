*Felimorphosis*

**D**: [sum] rounds

You have incredibly swift reactions, faster than the eye can see. You can make a free combat maneuver like a grapple, a disarm, or switching position with an adjacent creature whenever attacked.

With 4 [dice], the spell grants you an extra action on your turn.
