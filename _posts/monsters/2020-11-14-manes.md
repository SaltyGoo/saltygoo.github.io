**Undesired Souls.** Unclaimed by gods they drift through hell where they are used for construction and for sustenance. Desperate, weak.
Sometimes raked out of the Styx by [barbazus](/monsters/barbazu) to serve in a war. A tiny divine servant.

_Imagine the melted skin of a shrinked human dragging itself across the floor begging for help with their tiny hands and distorted mouth._
