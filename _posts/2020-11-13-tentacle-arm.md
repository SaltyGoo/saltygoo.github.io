You transform one of your hands into a long tentacle and and grapple something.  Then, you choose one:

- **Crush It!**: It takes [sum] damage and cannot move on its next turn.
- **Throw It!** You shove the target 30' in one direction. It takes [sum] damage and falls prone.
- **Drag It!** You may pull the target closer, or pull yourself closer if the target is heavier.
