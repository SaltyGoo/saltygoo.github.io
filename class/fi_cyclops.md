<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Club, and choose three times: a Boulder or a Sheep.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Island life, Orc Culture, or Mountain Life.

For every Cyclops template you have, you grow 1', increasing your HP by 1 and giving you an extra Inventory slot.

**A:** One Big Eye, Big Boulder<br>
**B:** Glaring Weakness<br>
**C:** Blind Fury, Evil Eye<br>
**D:** Forge of the Gods<br>

## One Big Eye
Your gaze is powerful. You can make anyone aware that you are looking at them, even if they don't see you. When you do, roll a D20 and note the result: this is the result of your next d20 interaction with them. Do what you will with that information. You can only use this ability once per person per day. You cannot use any of your abilities while you are blinded.

## Big Boulder
In your hands, heavy objects inflict at least 1D12 damage when thrown. You can use your STR or your DEX when throwing things. 

Also, when you rest in a rocky natural environment, you can build a cyclopean wall as thick as 10', as wide as 20' and as tall as 15'.

## Glaring Weakness
You can reduce the damage of an incoming attack you can see by 1D6. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) until the end of your next turn.

## Blind Fury
You can reroll your damage rolls and choose the best result. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to all things that are not your target until your next turn.

## Evil Eye
When a creature you can see casts a spell, you can force it to choose between taking 1D6 psychic damage or miscasting the spell. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to all things that are not the caster until your next turn.

## Forge of the Gods
As you gain this ability and every time you spend at least a [treasure](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) carousing, you craft one of the following:

- A solid **lightning bolt** that inflicts 1D20 damage when thrown, never misses, and reappears in your hand after. Each time it is thrown, its damage die shrinks by one size.
- A **giant trident** (1D12) that can summon a horse- or hippocampus-drawn chariot which allows 3 people to travel over land and sea at such speed that they cross in one day what would normally take one week. Has 2 one-day charges.
- A **cap** that allows its wearer to become invisible for 1 hour. Each time it is used, the duration is reduced by 10 minutes.
