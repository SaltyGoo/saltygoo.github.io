###### By SaltyGoo. This was initially a monster class for the [Cacus](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/cacus). A monster class must be the first class you take. Ask your referee if the monster exists in their world, or you could just have met one in one of your previous adventures.

Wow, look at you sunbathing naked on that rock, oblivious to the world's worries. Who would blame you: you are taller than any human, more cunning and more beautiful. Up to this day, you've been charming and stealing your way through life, herding your sheeps on the mountains, winning sports competition.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Shepherd staff. Loincloth.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Wrestling, herding, your starting weapon.

For every Oiled-up Muscle Giant template you have, increase your wrestling skill by 1.

**A:** Body Oil, Oiled Up I<br>
**B:** Oiled Up II, Scoundrel<br>
**C:** Oiled Up III<br>
**D:** Font of Shine, Spitfire<br>

## Body Oil
Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to produce enough oil to cover one human-sized creature or object, or a 10' square flat space. This oil is highly slippery, highly flammable and dries up in 1 hour. It smells like you.

## Oiled Up I
While you are oiled up, you have advantage on your attempts to seduce or charm.

## Oiled Up II
While you are oiled up, you cannot be grappled.

## Scoundrel
When you succeed on a fighting maneuvre, you can plant or steal a small object on your opponent.

## Oiled Up III
When you are oiled up and an enemy misses a melee attack against you, you can make a fighting maneuvre against it.

## Font of Shine
You can use your Body Oil ability twice per day.

## Spitfire
You can create a spark by snapping your fingers. Instead of using your Body Oil ability, you can spit a cone of fire and ignite 2 adjacent nearby targets. The cone inflicts 2D6 fire damage, halved on a save. Targets who fail their save continue taking 1 damage every round until they extinguish the flames.
