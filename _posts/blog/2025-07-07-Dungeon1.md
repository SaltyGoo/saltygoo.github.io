title: Dungeon Generator 1 - WINTERMILL
---


Since my **[dungeon generator](/pages/randomdungeon2/)** _beta_ now has 50 monsters to pick from, I wanted to earnestly try to use it and flesh out the results into something more coherent. For this dungeon, I settled on trying something that would fit in a highland plateau. With that in mind, I set the generator's biomes to _Plains_ and _Mountain_.

Here's the result that I got from the generator:

<summary>Creative Process</summary>
The **generated dungeon features** implie an old stone structure recently inhabited by humanoids. The plural levitating islands tell me I’ll need to group the rooms in separate island blocks and find ways to link them.

Looking at the **encounter table**, I notice it has two types of beasts, two types of humanoids, and one magical creature. It feels natural to group the bounty hunters and knights together as a faction. The air elementals would make a good rival faction, as they must be protecting the sky from something. While the hawks and griffons could be mounts or just roaming creatures. There’s a hint of a plot developing.

Looking at **the rooms**, I could imagine “entering” through the *cliffside path*, connecting to the highest peak and the rope bridge. It seems perfect as an introduction: the danger (falling) is clearly telegraphed and there are NPCs to drag the players in the dungeon’s conflict. The rope bridge could connect to the only other man-made room of the dungeon: the windmill, on a floating island, which could be the knights’ base. I’m left with the elemental portal and the thin spire. I want the elemental portal to be the base of the elementals, so I don't want it adjacent to the windmill. The spire could be on the same island however, with the windmill hanging from it. By placing the portal on a separate flying island and making it accessible by gliding from either the highest peak or the spire, I have created a nice loop and the architecture is complete! Let’s call this place Wintermill. The challenge of describing this dungeon is that most of it is outdoors, so nearly all visible at once, but it will make for a great exploration puzzle.

# Wintermill

Built by a wizard in the mountains a decade or so ago, Wintermill has caused much grief to the pastoral clans living in the highlands below: Since its appearance, summers have been cold and the pastures grown barren. To remedy the situation, the clans have pooled together their reserves of mountain poppies to hire two questing dream-knights of St-Nugibert. You do not have much time left if you want to claim the secrets of Wintermill and the bounty for yourself.

<ins>Possible Hooks</ins>
- Mountain poppy, which is mainly used in religious rituals by the locals, is a powerful narcotic and worth a lot of money in the Empire (enough to level up). It is used by dream-knights to astrally project for days.
- The dream-knights of St-Nugibert are based in the dream-fortress of the same name in the astral plane. If you would help them, they could give you access.
- The local shepherds' description of Wintermill would suggest the presence of a portal to the elemental plane of cold. Many powerful beings are imprisoned there.
- Bardinal, the wizard who built the mill, was a well known inventor. The mill must have an arcane purpose that you could harness.

### General Features

*Brisk and cold air. Climbable eroded stone surfaces. Two floating islands 200' above the ground and 90' away from the mountain's flank. During daytime, you can see giant hawks swooping through the cold wind of the **winter portal (#6)**.*

### Encounter Table
D6 every 30 minutes. The dungeon does not repopulate. You can also roll 1D6 every 20 minute to see in which room **Cunegund** and here crew are, and again to see where **Springsun** is.

- <ins>Disposition</ins>: Lazy and cowardly. These two only care about each other now that Synard and Marion are dead.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>3. <b>Springsun the <a href="/monsters/bounty-hunter">Religious Bounty Hunter</a></b></summary>

There are 2 hawks in total. They can be observed using the drafts from the portal (#6) to gain altitude during the day. If one were to latch to them as they swoop to attack, they would certainly end up being dragged above the portal. At night they nest atop the snowy peak (#3).

- <ins>Has</ins>: The ability to fly.
