*Fluffy white bats with freezing venom.*

Arctic bats are white and fluffy, which gives them excellent camouflage in snow. They are carnivores.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** tiny &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 1 / 7 / 4 / 1 / 6 / 2   <br>
**Resistances:** cold <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 0 <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark.

**Echolocation:** As long as it can hear, the bat can detect invisible creatures.

**Snowflake**: During a snowstorm, all attacks against the arctic bat are made with disadvantage.

**Attacks:** Each round, the arctic bat can bite (x). On a hit, the target must save vs poison or slowly freeze and be restrained. The target can save again at the end of its next turn to cure the effect. On a second failure, the target is frozen for 24h. This effect only happens in subzero temperatures.

Arctic bat fur is very fluffy, but a huge amount of bats must be skinned to make a coat, making it very expensive. Arctic bat venom is valued as a food preserver.
