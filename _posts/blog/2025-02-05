Rules and design notes for the **Baldur's Gate I Hexcrawl**

##
Hot Springs Island is made up of twenty-five 2-mile hexes. Each
hex contains three points of interest for players to discover
and explore. These points are all physical locations that can be
revisited, and are not one-time events or encounters.
Three locations per hex make the wilderness feel dense. But to keep
things abstract, these locations do not have fixed coordinates within
the hex. Each one is numbered (01, 02, 03), and characters will
generally encounter point 01 first, as it is normally an obvious natural
feature or settlement. The second and third points are typically less
obvious, but remain noteworthy locales. These additional locations
are best discovered by parties that have become lost, spend time
exploring, or are revealed by an NPC guide or object.
Players should have access to a map of Hot Springs Island as they
play, and the map enclosed with the Field Guide has blanks to fill in
as points of interest are discovered. This way, in addition to being
destinations, the locations can serve as a sort of collection minigame,
showing players that more is out there, just waiting to be found.
