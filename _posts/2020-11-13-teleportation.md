R:  sight

[dice] creatures holding hands, including you, are teleported to any location you can see. Roll a D20. If you roll under [dice], choose if each teleported creature gains a [random mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html), takes 1D4 [wounds](/2020/11/09/base-rules/#dying--healing), or is lost in the [astral sea](/pages/fantasylandgenerator/)
 
Alternatively, if you are in a dungeon, you can safely teleport to a random room in it.
