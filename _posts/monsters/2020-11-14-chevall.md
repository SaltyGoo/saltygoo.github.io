*Horsewere that can turn into a centaur. Fey.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Originating from [Mystara](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/chevall.html), the chevall must be one of the weirdest official DnD monster, which makes me want to find ways to use it. First of all, its name is just horse in French with an extra L. Secondly, its a horse that can transform into a centaur, not the other way around!  — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine the upper body of a human joined to the body of a horse. A centaur then, except it has horse ears and eyes. It strangely looks like a horse you've seen before.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / 6 / 7 / 5 / 7 / 6 <br>
**Resistances:** weapons, magic <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Chevalls have exceptional endurance and very keen eyes. They can speak the tongue of horses and have advantage on all their charisma rolls towards equine creatures. It is not slowed down when grappling creatures.

**Shapechange:** The chevall can take the shape of a horse at will.

**Attacks:**  Each round, the chevall can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Tremple.</ins> The chevall moves all its movement and makes two melee attacks (x) against different targets. This attacks inflicts extra damage (x) to prone creatures.

<ins>Charge.</ins> The chevall moves all its movement in a straight line and attacks a target with its hooves (x). If the chevall is in centaur form, it can make a grapple attempt.

<ins>Summon Horses (1/day).</ins> The chevall summon 1D6 horses which will obey it.

<ins>Command Horse.</ins> The chevall gives a two-word order to a horse it can see and the horse must obey it. It must be a order that can be followed in one action.

## Salvaging the Body

A bow made of chevall mane shoots exceptionally well and makes even better music.

Chevall leather is very supple, and makes excellent saddles. Except that no equine creatures will want to be ridden with one.

By learning how to whisper to mares like a chevall, a wizard can create a new spell with the word *horse*.

<span class="alchemy">**Chevall Musk.** Is very pleasant to equine creatures.</span>
