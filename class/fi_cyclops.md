<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Choose three times: a Club, a Boulder, a Sheep.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Throwing, and your choice of Island life, Orc Culture, or Mountain Life.

For every Cyclops template you have, you grow 1', increaing your HP by 1 and giving you an extra Inventory slot.

**A:** One Big Eye, Boulder Throw<br>
**B:** Blind Fury<br>
**C:** Glaring Weakness<br>
**D:** Evil Eye<br>

## One Big Eye
Your gaze is powerful. You can make anyone aware that you are looking at them, even if they don't see you. When you do so, you learn if they are good or bad news, and they learn you are bad news. People you have looked into in such way have easier access to your soul.

## Boulder Throw
In your hands, heavy objects inflict at least 1D12 damage when thrown.

## Blind Fury
You can reroll your damage rolls and choose the best result. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) to all things that are not your target until your next turn.

## Glaring Weakness
You can reduce the damage of an incoming attack you can see by 1D6. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until the end of your next turn.

## Evil Eye
When a creature you can see casts a spell, you can force it to choose between taking 1D6 psychic damage or miscasting the spell. If you do, you are [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) to all things that are not the caster until your next turn.
