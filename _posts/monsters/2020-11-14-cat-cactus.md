*Desert cat with hallucinogenic quills. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The cactus cat is an cryptid from the South-Western United-State. In the myth, it gets drunk and violent on fermented cactus sap. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)’s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) gives it hallucinogenic quills. I say why not both? — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a greenish gray bobcat with quills on its back. It stares at you in a drunken torpor.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 3 / 7 / 5 / 2 / 6 / 3  <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1 <br>
**Movement:** fast, climb average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Cats are stealthy and have a very keen sense of sight and smell allowing them to operate in the dark. Additionally, cactus cat can unsurprisingly easily hide within cacti. The cactus cat is immune to cactus fever.

**Attacks:** Each round, the cactus cat can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Claws.</ins> The cactus cat makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Quill Spray.</ins> The cactus cat sprays a short cone with quills. Creatures who fail to dodge take damage (x) and must make a save vs poison or be poisoned with cactus fever.

<span class:"alchemy">**Cactus Fever.** Save or be poisoned, save again each 10 minutes to cure. While poisoned, you are a drunken mess: each player names a different emotion and rolls a D20, the referee alters your actions in a dramatic way according to the emotion with the highest roll. Roll a new emotion every 10 minutes.</span>
