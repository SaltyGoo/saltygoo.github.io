title: Gremlin, Gremishka
---

Kleptomaniac house fairy. A tiny fey.

Imagine a pint-sized, furred, cat-eyed humanoid with a muzzle. It moves around at high speed, often passing for a house cat or a rat, but its long fingered hands and feet and oversized toothy mouth betrays its supernatural nature.

_Vicious tricksters, Nagging coward, Hysterical pest._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 | **Armor:** none |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast     |   | 

It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** see in the dark, and be very sneaky.
**Also**, as a imaginary creature, willpower must be used for attack rolls against it instead of dexterity.

Gremishkas are notably allergic to magic. If a spell is cast within 30' of one of them, roll a D3 on this table once:

1. The caster nearly mishaps. It gains [1 Doom Point](/class/wizard#spells).
2. The gremishkas nearby grow! They gain 1D4 extra HP.
3. The gremishkas multiply! Add a new swarm of them to the encounter.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite and Scratches</ins>. The gremishka makes a melee attack (1 damage). It then sneaks away nearby.

<ins>Steal</ins>. A target in melee range must save or have a small object stolen from their inventory. The gremishka then sneaks away nearby.

# Gremishka Swarm

|  <span style="display: inline-block; width:250px"></span>  |  |
| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 + 3D4HP| **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast     |   | 

It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** see in the dark, and be very sneaky.
**Also**, as a imaginary creature, willpower must be used for attack rolls against it instead of dexterity.

In a swarm, creatures are **immune** to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and **resist** mind and weapon damage. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

Gremishkas are notably allergic to magic. If a spell is cast within 30' of one of them, roll a D3 on this table once:

1. The caster nearly mishaps. It gains [1 Doom Point](/class/wizard#spells).
2. The gremishkas in range grow! They gain 1D8 extra HP.
3. The gremishkas multiply! Add a new swarm of them to the encounter.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bites.</ins> To dodge a swarmâ€™s attack, the roll has to beat 10 + the swarm's HP. It inflicts 1D4 damage. If it inflicts 4 damage or more in a single attack, it steals an object from the target.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

There is not much to do with the tiny naked body of a gremishka. Maybe an ugly fur coat could be made with the skin of 30 of them?

A wizard who manages to live in a house infected by gremishkas and ignore them for 7 days straight has the mad inspiration to write a spell with the word _kettle_ in it.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The original gremishka comes from [Ravenloft](https://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/gremishk.html), and like many Ravenloft creatures, it is full of creepy flavor. For once, the [5e version](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/993-gremishka-terrify-spellcasters-with-these-tiny) made them even more interesting, adding OSR-style chaos to them. I tried to stay faithful to both.</details>
