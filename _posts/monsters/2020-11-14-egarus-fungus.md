It **can** detect physical matter in its vicinity.
It **can't** see or hear.
**Additionally**, the fungus is entirely sticky. It gets stuck to anything it touches and a fortitude roll is required to remove it (It will then be stuck to the thing that removed it). Any damage it takes while stuck on a creature is also taken by the creature.

<summary>Credits</summary>
Egarus fungi are a strange [Planescape monster](https://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/e/egarus.html) it was very fun to adapt such a deadly and weird creature. I simply streamlined it and opened more opportunities to deal with it creatively: the original was only affected by a handful of specific spells.  — SaltyGoo
