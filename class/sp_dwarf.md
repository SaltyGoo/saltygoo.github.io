To take dwarf templates, you must be a dwarf.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
leather armor, axe, rough iron shield. 

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your starting weapon, your trade (roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html)).

For every Dwarf template you have, increase the number of [armor pieces](/2020/11/09/base-rules#equipment) you can wear by 1.

**A:** Innate Sense, Stony Recovery, Obsession<br>
**B:** Greed<br>
**C:** Heart of the Mountain<br>
**D:** Liver of the Delver<br>

## Innate Sense
You can smell/taste craftsmanship within 10’. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors.

## Stony Recovery
When you die from poison or disease, you are petrified for a session, then return to life at 1 HP, purified of the malady.

## Obsession
Every time you end a session in a civilized location, roll wisdom. On a failure, spend the next session making an object of power related to your story or profession. Then roll 1D4 to see how many [Treasures](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) you spend doing this (you might go in debt). Describe what you’d like it to be and the GM will describe what it actually is.

## Greed
Gain a +1 bonus to saves for each inventory slot filled with [Treasure](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) carried beyond the first 4, or filled with any Great Treasure.

## Heart of the Mountain
Always knows when all the secret doors and passages on a floor have been discovered.

## Liver of the Delver
You can sense the general direction of exits and stairs to other levels.
