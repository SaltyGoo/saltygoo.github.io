title: Deliver from Malison
---

Mix valuable oil and water in a shallow plate while pleading Fate, Chance and the Gods to deliver a victim from a curse or any negative spell. The victim can be a creature, object or area. Roll a D4. If the result is equal or lower than [dice], the curse will be lifted. If not, it still will be, but only after the victim (or a postulant if the curse afflicts an item or place) performs a specific act determined by the Referee: 

- Completes a pilgrimage .
- Offers appropriate sacrifices, worth at least a Treasure per victim, often more. 
- Makes appropriate amends.
