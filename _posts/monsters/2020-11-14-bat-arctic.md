Fluffy white bats with freezing venom. A tiny beast.

_Arctic bats are white and fluffy, which gives them excellent camouflage in snow. They are swarming carnivores._

It **resists** cold. It **can** hear very well, allowing it to easily spot their preys in the dark, even invisible ones. It also looks like a big snowflake while moving, making attacks against it disadvantageous during snowstorms.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite</ins>. The arctic bat makes a melee attack. On a hit, the target must save vs poison or slowly freeze and be [dazed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). The target can save again at the end of its next turn to cure the effect. On a second failure, the target is frozen for 24h. This effect only happens in subzero temperatures.

# Arctic Bat Swarm

|  <span style="display: inline-block; width:250px"></span>  |  |
| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 +3D4HP | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** special  |
| **Move:** slow, fly fast     |   | 

It **resists** cold. It **can** hear very well, allowing it to easily spot their preys in the dark, even invisible ones. It also looks like a big snowflake while moving, making attacks against it disadvantageous during snowstorms.

In a swarm, creatures are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bites.</ins> To dodge a swarm's attack, the roll has to beat its HP. On a hit, the target must save vs poison or slowly freeze and be [dazed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). The target can save again at the end of its next turn to cure the effect. On a second failure, the target is frozen for 24h. This effect only happens in subzero temperatures.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>
Arctic bat fur is very fluffy, but a huge amount of bats must be skinned to make a coat, making it very expensive. Arctic bat venom is valued as a food preserver.

Arctic bat seem to be an original creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I loved the idea of the freezing venom. â€” SaltyGoo
