**D**: 1 year

You hand another creature a nonmagical object. They must willingly take it from you. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: finger-sized, 2 [dice]: head-sized, 3 [dice]: torso-sized, 4 [dice]: person-sized. Up to [sum] rounds later, at a time you chose, the object permanently turns into vermin: maggots, spiders, centipedes, and slime. The creatures aren't hostile or venomous, but their bites itch and they probably don't want to be held.

Afterward, and for the duration of the spell, the creature who took the gift will fail its next [dice] saves or combat rolls against you.
