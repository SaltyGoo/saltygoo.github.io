###### Beast. Adapted from [the MonsterManual (5e)](https://5e.tools/book.html#mm)

Bats are nocturnal insectivores that nest in dark spaces.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** tiny &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 1 / 7 / 4 / 1 / 6 / 2   <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 0 <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark.

**Echolocation:** As long as it can hear, the bat can detect invisible creatures.

**Attacks:** Each round, the bat can bite (x).

If you have been bitten by a bat, roll a D10 before you rest. On a roll of one you have caught bat flu.

<span class="alchemy">**Bat Flu**. Disease. Symptom: fatigue. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Spreads through contact and breathing. </span>
