<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Choose three times: a Weapon of your choice, 12 pieces of Ammunition, a Piece of Armor of your choice.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Imperial Infantry, Imperial Navy, Celebrity Bodyguard, or Caravan Life.

For every Fighter template you have, you gain a bonus of 1 to you attack rolls.

**A:** Weapon Training, Parry <br>
**B:** Grit <br>
**C:** Steel Gaze <br>
**D:** Double Attack <br>

## Weapon Training
Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you decide to inflict with them:
- <ins>Bludgeoning:</ins> You can reduce your damage die by 1 size (1D8>1D6>1D4 etc) and attempt to shove as part of your attack.
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> Hitting a [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or suprised target inflicts 1D6 extra damage.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> When you roll max damage, you can make another attack.

## Parry
Once per battle, you can destroy a weapon or a shied you are holding to protect yourself or an adjacent ally from an attack's damage. 

## Grit
You can have as many [Scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) as your WIL without them taking inventory slots.

## Steel Gaze
You project an intimidating aura that lets people know you are a skilled warrior. At any moment, you can decide how weak creatures react to you: they either avoid angering you at all costs, or focus all their anger on you, ignoring your teammates. Weak creatures are any monster with 2 HD or less.

## Double Attack
You can attack twice during your turn.
