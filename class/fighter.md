**B:** Grit <br>

## Weapon Training
Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you inflict with them:
- <ins>Bludgeoning:</ins> You can roll FOR after you hit to knock the target prone.
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> Hitting a [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or suprised target inflicts 1D6 extra damage.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> When you roll max damage, you can make another attack.

## Parry
Once per battle, you can destroy a weapon or a shied you are holding to protect yourself or an adjacent ally from an attack's damage. 

## Grit
You can have as many [Scars](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) as your WIL without them taking inventory slots.

## Steel Gaze
You project an intimidating aura that lets people know you are a skilled warrior. At any moment, you can decide how weak creatures react to you: they either avoid angering you at all costs, or focus all their anger on you, ignoring your teammates. Weak creatures are any monster with 2 HD or less.

## Weapon Mastery
Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you inflict with them:
- <ins>Bludgeoning:</ins> Damaging a non-gigantic target knocks it [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> Damaging a [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or surprised _unnamed_ living target kills it.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> You make two attacks.
