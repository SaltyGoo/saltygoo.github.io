**R**: Touch

Your touch causes the chaotic workings of life to permeate nonliving matter, up to approximately the volume of [dice] humans at a time. 

One turn of contact leads to softening and weakness, as veins, entrails, and other organic appurtenances metastasize, and after three turns of contact, the matter collapses entirely into warm, pulsing slime.

During each turn of contact, there is a 1 in 6 chance of the transforming matter spawning some hitherto unseen organism, though such spawns are almost certainly unviable. 

Furthermore, living creatures touched during the workings of this spell are subject to [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) if a saving throw is failed.
