**R**: 60’ **D**: [dice]D6 rounds

The moon must be clearly visible for this spell to be cast. You make a creature in range obsessed by the it: It wants to stare at it, jump up and hold it, or write poems about it, becoming effectively [stunned](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) as long as they see it. If the target takes damage, the spell ends.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the target is permanently obsessed by the moon.
