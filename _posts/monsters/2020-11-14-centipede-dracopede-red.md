*Armored centipede with a flaming breath attack. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a bright-red centipede as long as a dog. It eats burnt organic matter.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 2 / 7 / 6 / 1 / 3 / 1  <br>
**Resistances:** fire<br>

**Damage:** 1D4 <br>
**Movement:** average, climb average &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Dracopedes cant see well but detects movement within 30’. The green dracopede is well camouflaged in plants.

**Attacks:** Each round, the dracopede can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (x).

<ins>Defensive Curl.</ins> The dracopede curls into a ball. As long as it stays in this position, it cannot be damaged by missile weapons and one-handed melee weapons.

<ins>Flammable Spray (recharge 2/6).</ins> The dracopede spits flammable acid in a 10’ cone. Those who fail their dodge take fire damage (x). And again (x) every turn until the sticky liquid is removed.

This attack has no effect in cool temperatures.

## Salvaging the Body

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<span class="alchemy">**Red Dracospit.** Flammable liquid that builds pressure when shaken. Reacts to air in warm temperatures.</span>
