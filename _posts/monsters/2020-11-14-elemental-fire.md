Sentient fire. A fire elemental.

_Imagine fire moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in sizzles and flickers._

_Hungry, envious, simmering rage._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** X | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast    |   | 

It is **immune** to fire, mundane weapons, and being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it's gaseous). 
It **resists** all other damage (because it's an elemental).
It **can** shape flames at will, and move through any small hole.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round it touches something flammable.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent without fuel. In general, it has the same properties as fire such as shedding light and being snuffed by water.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Incinerate</ins>. The elemental makes a melee attack (XD4 damage). On a hit, the target can choose to take an extra 1D4 damage, or sacrifice an item to the flames.

<ins>Create Flames</ins> (X/day). The elemental can start a 5' fire on a flammable object nearby.
