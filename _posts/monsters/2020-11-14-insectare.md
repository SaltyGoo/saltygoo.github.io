title: Insectare
---

Space-faring cricket-folk disguised as elves. An aberration.

_Imagine a beautiful elf, skin like porcelain. If you could get close, you’d see its eyes are compounded. If you could see under its elaborate scarves and cloak, you’d discover a chitinous insectoid body with joints like a puppet’s. If unmasked, it uncoils two cricket-like body-length antennae._

_Spy on a mission, Cold elegance, Insectoid twitches._

It is impossible to distinguish a disguised insectare from an elf when not adjacent to it.

It **resists** mind attacks (because it's an aberration).
It **can** jump 60', lie extremely well and see in the dark.
It **can't** die unless it's would-be killer saves vs fear.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Saber Jump.</ins> The insectare makes a melee attack (1D6) and jumps 60' away.

<ins>Antennae Whips.</ins> The insectare makes two melee attacks with reach (1D2). On a hit, a target must save or drop its weapon.

<summary>Design Notes</summary>
Insectare are weird! They are a spelljammer race whose shtick is to be pretend to be elves. Like a moth pretending to be an owl but more sinister.</details>
