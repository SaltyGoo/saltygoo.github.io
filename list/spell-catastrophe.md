_Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 Doom Point. Every time you gain a Doom Point, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. Reroll results you already got._

### Your Powers Have Become Blasphemous! Catastrophe! Roll a D12.
1. **Last Warning.** Your forehead is branded with heretical writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to be judged. If this writing is intoned by _any_ spellcaster or cleric, a [greater divine agent](/list/monsters-celestial) will be summoned.
2. **Abyssal Poacher.** Every time an intelligent life dies because of your magic, their departed soul is fed to a [dretch demon](/monsters/dretch) which is immediately summoned, and is confused and ornery from being so disturbed.
3. **Infernal Representative.** Anyone that makes a deal with you in the future is actually making a deal with the devil duke who now owns your soul. However, they are not so informed. If they do not discharge the debt, any offspring they have will be replaced with a demon changeling marked with your sigil. Because of that, the devil will indirectly impede them in their action.
4. **Demonic Vessel**. The attention of a Demon Lord is attracted. It can now see whatever you see, and speak using your mouth, though the voice becomes different and ominous. Your eyes now glow a faint orange in darkness. Chaos will be sowed by it/you.
5. **Real Nightmares.** One randomly determined person near the casting of the spell is permanently marked with a demonic sigil. This sigil conjures a [lesser horror](/list/monsters-aberration) each time the afflicted person sleeps. Determine its reaction as normal.
6. **Out and Wicked**. You and all allies nearby grow long, curving, goatlike horns. These are permanent, and mark those so affected as traffickers in diabolic magic. Inquisitors are on their way
7. **Tainted Forever.** You are permanently imbued with the nature of demons, and becomes subject to many demonic weaknesses. For example, holy water becomes damaging, circles of protection keep you out, and so forth. Furthermore, you lose the ability to cross running water without collapsing into unconsciousness. Crossing a line of salt, such as used with some magic circles, causes you 1D6 damage.
8. **Familiar Vision.** An imp familiar is summoned. This familiar has your eyes, which cease to reside in your head. You continue to be able to see from the eyes, though do not control the imp directly. The imp may not travel more than 100 feet away from you. If it is slain, the eyes are banished to another place where swirling colors and running, pulsing veins are all that is visible.
9. **Hellish Revelation.** The skies of far off places open above you. The vista seen contains geometries beyond the abilities of mortals to understand. All witnessing this display stand in awe and must make a saving throw. On success, the insight gained increases all mental or spiritual ability scores by 1 point. On failure, one such score is permanently decreased by 1D6 points.
10. **Eternal Hunger.** You are bound to a demon of gluttony. In the future, prior to casting any spell, you must consume two full days of rations. You will never again feel satiated.
11. **Eldritch Gateway.** Every time you cast a spell in the future, there is a 1 in 6 chance of accidentally also summoning a [greater horror](/list/monsters-aberration), reaction determined as normal.
12. **Damnation.** The next time you reach 0 HP, you are immediately dragged to hell to be judged.
