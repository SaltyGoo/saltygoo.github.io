The Elf is a type of [Magic User](/class/magic-user). To take templates as an elf, you must be an elf.

<ins>Perk</ins><br>
You may add +1 SD to a spell if you are touching a large tree (at least 50â€™ high, roots count). This extra SD does not return to your pool or trigger catastrophes.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
If you are scarred, disfigured, or filthy you must save each morning or be unable to cast spells that day.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- Create a pleasant musical ringing sound.
- Any target you hit with an arrow counts as being in range for the purposes of your spells.
- Touch a wound to prevent it from bleeding. You do not negate any damage or remove wounds, but it does keep things neat and tidy. Faint white floral scars will form.
