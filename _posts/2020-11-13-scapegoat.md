**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

The last-ditch measure against spells is to have them fall on a preordained, sacrificial victim, like the proverbial goat. You must first trace your Sigil on a subject and on a scapegoat, a victim animal at least as big as a goat. Afterwards, if the scapegoat and the subject are close by, the first [dice] harmful spells affecting the subject will be directed at the scapegoat instead.
