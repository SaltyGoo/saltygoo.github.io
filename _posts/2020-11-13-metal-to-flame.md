title: Metal to Flame
---
**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] rounds

Metal was born of fire and bends to fire. You change a metal object in range into searing fire. The object maintains its mass and shape but scorches for 1D4 fire damage when worn or used as a weapon for each [dice] invested, and inflicts [dice] damage every subsequent turn of contact.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](https://saltygoo.github.io/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
