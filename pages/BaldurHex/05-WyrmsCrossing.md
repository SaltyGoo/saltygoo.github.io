<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Wyrm's Crossing </span>

Massive stone bridge that crosses the Chiontar along the Coast Way near Baldur's Gate. Rempant banditry has led the Flaming Fist mercenaries to close it until further notice.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Merchant Camp</span>

Merchant caravans from Amn and beyond that have survived the bandit raids are stuck here until the bridge is open. Tension is high.
