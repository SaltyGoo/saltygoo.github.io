**R**: Touch		**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You can animate a touched rope and give it commands. The rope, when held, can be completely controlled in its motion and can be made incredibly rigid and impervious to damage. In combat, it can trip/disarm/whip as a magic whip and hit like a staff using giving you a [dice] bonus to your rolls.
