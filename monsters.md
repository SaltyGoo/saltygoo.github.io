The slow, methodical conversion of more than 9000 monsters from DnD history to the GLoG.

## By Monster Type
I classify monsters in 8 thematic categories with some mechanical common thread, because I love when players can learn:

### Aberrations
Eldritch horrors and mutants. The chaotic demons of DnD are aberrations.

The alien weirdness of aberrations makes them all resistant to mind attacks. As true horrors, mortals need to succeed on a save vs fear to kill one, or have a platinum weapon.

Each aberration has a mutation table for when players want to try to harness their eldritch power.

### Beasts
Animals and plants. 

Beast are the most common creatures. From goat, to mushroom, to dragon, they are the basis of most ecosystems. Each monster sheet provides a guide for salvaging their body and a table for what they represent in local cultures.

### Construct
Animated machines.

Their lack of bodily functions makes them immune to such things as poison, diseases and sleep. They can be considered as objects for the purpose of spells and abilities and are vulnerable to anti-magic zones.

Being articifial creatures, each construct monster sheet has guidelines for its construction.

### Divine
Entities that enforce the laws of the gods. Angels and the lawful devils of DnD are celestials.

Their divine nature makes them resistant to everything, except radium.

Celestials trade in the souls that fuel the gods. Each of them have the power to make pacts with mortals, which all involve a quest, a reward and the soul of the mortal in case of a failure to comply. Evil celestials give the reward and the quest at the same time, then try to make accomplishing the quest impossible within the decided time frame. Good celestials give a quest first and the reward upon completion.

### Elementals
Pure sentient matter.

As such, they are resistant to all types of damage. Clever adventurers have found ways to negate this power by exploiting their physiciality: grounding air, freezing water, drenching fire, etc.

The goals of elementals are pretty straightforward in general, if a bit alien in their scale. Their what-the-monster-wants table illustrate that. Binging the raw power of an elemental to you is one of the very few ways an indivitual can get [Spell Dices](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells) outside of the magic user class. Its dangerous, and a binding table is provided to know the side effects. Finally, all elementals can be summoned. A variation of the [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/) spell unique to the elemental type is included in each monster sheet.

### Fairies
Are they the origin of magic or a consequence of magic? If elementals are pure matter, fairies are pure emotion.

Their magical nature makes them resistant to mundane weapons and spells, but cold iron has a terrible effect on them: they become powerless.

Each fey is fairly individualistic, and has a what-the-monster-wants table to know their fickle goal. All fairies can also help magic-users create new spell, and the way to do so is described in the monster's sheet.

### Humanoids
Humanoids are similar to beasts, with the notable distinction they have cultures and society.

Each humanoid monster sheet includes a loot table and a culture table to be able to generate a variety of unique cultures with immediate tension in your world. Also each humanoid comes with a monster class, if players want to play as one of them.
