**R**: Sight

The target of this spell must have fingers. You snap your fingers and your target's fingers crack, break, and bend. They take [dice] damage and must immediately Save or drop whatever they are holding. Until healed, they will have disadvantage on any rolls made using the broken hand. You can choose to have the target take no damage, but they get advantage to their Save.

###### finger + break
