title: Centipede, Dracopede, Black
---

Armored centipede with a poison breath attack. A beast.

Imagine a spiked, armored centipede as long as a dog, and as black as ebony. It eats organic matter.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile and sturdy but weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** average, climb average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Dracopedes can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, with little difficulty. They cant see well but detects nearby movement.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (1D4) inflicting additional poison damage (1D4). If this damage would inflict wounds to the target, it falls asleep instead.

<ins>Defensive Curl.</ins> The dracopede curls into a ball. As long as it stays in this position, it cannot move or attack, nor be damaged by missile weapons and one-handed melee weapons.

<ins>Poison Spray (recharge 2/6).</ins> The dracopede spits poison in a short cone. Those who fail to dodge take poison damage (1D4) and are poisoned for 1 minute.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.

<span class="alchemy">**Black Dracospit.** Save or take damage and be poisoned, save again each day to cure. This damage cannot inflict wounds, but causes sleep instead.</span>

Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste.
