D: 10 minutes

You create 1D4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other, so that it is impossible to tell which is which. 

When an enemy attacks you, roll a D6 to see if they hit you or an image. If it rolls below the number of images, it hits an image instead. An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a solid impact. Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to vanish.
