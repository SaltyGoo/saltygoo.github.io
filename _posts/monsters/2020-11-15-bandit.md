<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some [humanoids](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-humanoid) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. If necessary, you can adjust the damage to match the base monster's.* </span>

Bandits are outlaws or goons that operate outside of the structure of an army and the culture of a tribe. They can be found anywhere there are people.
