## Heroism & Scars

After a session, note one heroic thing you did. You can add 1 to a Skill that directly relates to this gesture. 

Also, after a session, note one brush with death you’ve had. You now have a scar and advantage against that specific danger (as defined by the referee). You can only have as many scars as your Constitution.

## Damage Types

Experienced adventurers always bring a variety of weapons with them. Each type has a special effect when more than 5 damage is inflicted in one attack:

<ins>Blunt:</ins> the target falls Prone if it is smaller than you.

<ins>Piercing:</ins> the target takes double damage if Prone or Surprised (at any damage).

<ins>Slashing:</ins> an adjacent target has to dodge or take half damage.

<ins>Acid:</ins> armor is reduced by 2.<br>
<ins>Cold:</ins> take 2 dexterity damage.<br>
<ins>Electric:</ins> acts last next turn.<br>
<ins>Fire:</ins> cannot heal this turn.<br>
<ins>Mind:</ins> take 2 intelligence damage.<br>
<ins>Magical:</ins> must save to cast spells next turn.<br>
<ins>Poison:</ins> take 2 constitution damage.

## Stat Damage

Various monsters and spells can damage your stats instead of your HP. Here is what happens when one of your stats reaches 0:

<ins>Strength:</ins> you are Stunned, yet can talk.<br>
<ins>Dexterity:</ins> you are Prone and cant stand.<br>
<ins>Constitution:</ins> you are Dying.<br>
<ins>Intelligence:</ins> you are Dazed and mute.<br>
<ins>Wisdom:</ins> you are Confused.<br>
<ins>Charisma:</ins> you are forgotten. Nobody, even friends, can help you in any way.

## Conditions

<ins>Blinded:</ins> Cannot see. You are disadvantaged on your attacks and Dexterity. Others are advantaged on their attacks.

<ins>Charmed:</ins> You cannot attack, hurt or say anything bad to or about the source of the charm. You fail all rolls against it. 

<ins>Confused:</ins> Each round, you must declare three potential actions that are fully distinct from each other (no shared objects or verbs). Roll 1D3 and do one randomly.

<ins>Cursed:</ins> You cannot benefit from any magic.

<ins>Dazed:</ins> You can act OR move on your turn.  

<ins>Deafened:</ins> You cant hear. Your teammates cannot talk to you.

<ins>Dying:</ins> See [[ combat | base-rules#combat ]].

<ins>Fatigued:</ins> -1 to all stats. Cumulative.

<ins>Frightened:</ins> You cannot interact with the source of your fear until you have spent a full turn without seeing it. Roll a D6: 1, drop whatever you are holding; 2, scream; 3, fall prone; 4, grapple closest ally or object; 5, you are stunned for one turn; 6, run away.

<ins>Grappled:</ins> Cannot move.

<ins>Invisible:</ins> Advantage on attack rolls and stealth. Attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

<ins>Petrified:</ins> You are stunned. You resist the first 10 damage of each attack.

<ins>Poisoned:</ins> You are disadvantaged in all your actions. Poisons, diseases and other substances have other unique effects depending on the source.

<ins>Prone:</ins> You are easier to hit in melee, but harder at range. You cannot attack very well nor move very fast. Standing up takes all your movement for the turn.

<ins>Stunned:</ins> You skip your turn and you fail all Strength and Dexterity rolls. Melee attacks automatically hit you, ranged ones have advantage.

## Rare Metals

A good monster hunter knows which weapon to bring to slay which beast. Different metals have the potential to overcome a beast’s most impervious resistances.

<ins>Adamantium:</ins> Nothing is more solid than adamantium. An object hit by adamantium takes double damage, including constructs. An adamantium object is unbreakable.

<ins>Cold Iron:</ins> A faerie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

<ins>Silver:</ins> Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and creatures that are not in their true form.

<ins>Mithral:</ins> Is light like cloth. Weapons made of mithral can be used with Dexterity. Armors made of mithral do not penalize Dexterity.

<ins>Radium:</ins> Radium sheds light like a candle. It ignore the resistances of celestial creatures. Will poison mortals over time.

<ins>Platinum:</ins> Platinum repairs itself. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrationns, as well as their save to kill ability.

## Treasures

In a dungeon, you can find Valuables, Treasures, and Great Treasures. Each take 1 inventory slot. Valuables can be traded to buy things 1:1. Treasures can be traded to buy expensive things. Great Treasures are unique and worth 4 treasures. None of these have any utility besides trade and leveling up.

## Traveling

Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action takes 10 minutes. Roll for encounters every 30 minutes. Ask the players to choose odd or even, if they lose, one torch or lantern is depleted.

On the world map, crossing a hex takes half a day. Roll for encounters twice per day. Environmental penalties can happen.

## Between Adventures

Leveling up is just one way of gaining new powers. This is where you can convert treasures in character levels. If one of the following options allow you to roll on a table, you can roll once per treasure spent and choose the outcome you prefer.

Are you in a city? You can spend a treasure to **carouse**. Roll on the  [Camp Follower Table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html "Coins and Scrolls"). Make a constitution check, if you fail, roll on the [Carousing Table](https://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html "Jeff's Gameblog"). You level up if you spent 4 treasures.

You could also spend a treasure to **build** and furnish a small room somewhere, or **hire** or maintain a follower (up to your Charisma).

Do you have access to a humanoid? You can spend a treasure to **learn** a language, a skill from them, or even new attacks.

Have you captured or slain a beast? You could spend a treasure to **craft** an item with its parts, **tame** one, or teach it a new one-word order.

Can you cast spells? You can spend treasures **researching** new spells by combining words from spells you already know. If you have a fey’s charm, you can be even more creative. 

You have access to an aberration, a demon or a book about them? Be careful, but you could spend a treasure to roll on their **mutation** tables. Some are even beneficial! 

Can you talk or summon a divine creature, a devil? You can spend treasure to roll on their **pact** and reward table. You might get a good deal.

Do you have access to a construct or a book about them? You could spend treasures to **create** one!

Have access to an elemental spirit? You could spend treasures to **bind** one to you and gain magical powers, or learn how to **summon** one.

Would you dare to study the undead? You could spend treasures to learn how to **create** one or even become one.

All these tables are in the monster section held by the referee and should be negotiated with them. SoonTM
