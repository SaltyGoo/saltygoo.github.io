**R**: Touch		**D**: [dice] uses

All closed doors and secured entrances have a plasmic lock in addition to any material latches. Opening the plasmic lock voids any material fastening, but requires the fabrication of a plasmic key, which is consumed (if material) by the plasmic lock when used. The key for a particular plasmic lock is (roll a D6): 

1. A weapon that has been bloodied in anger.
1. A freshly severed finger .
1. A debt to a celestial being.
1. A song enthusiastically sung.
1. The sacrifice of a sinnerâ€™s life.
1. A randomly determined possession (significant in terms of encumbrance).

Alternatively, a plasmic key can be used to lock any figurative or real opening.
