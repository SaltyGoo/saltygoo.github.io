D: Sigil

You carve your Sigil in your flesh and make a declarative statement about your body stating [dice] new facts. You cannot add limbs, mass or make yourself impervious to any damage. Your statement is true for the duration of the spell. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
