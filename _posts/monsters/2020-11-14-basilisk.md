##### Mythtical monster originating from Ancient Greece. This version is inspired by the one in [the Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-tomb-of-serpent-kings-megapost.html).

_Imagine a large eight-legged lizard with a spine of quills and a square pupil._

Lumbering lizard with a petrifying gaze. A large opportunistic beast.

Basilisks are not aware of their power and eat whatever they petrify.

Because the basilisk's eyesight is poor, its sense of smell is very well developped. Even then, if the basilisk focuses its **gaze** on a creature for one round, the target’s limbs become heavy, slow, and gray. They must save or be functionally [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). This effect ends immediately if the basilisk looks away. If the basilisk stares at a target for a second round, they must save again or be [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). If they pass, they are still rooted in place (as above). The effect has a short range. More than one target can be affected, but they must be very close together.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite</ins>. The basilisk makes a melee attack (1D6 dmg). A [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) target takes extra poison damage (1D6) on a hit, and a [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) one, 2D6.

<ins>Frantic Charge</ins>. If it has the space for it, the basilisk runs in a straight line and makes an attack (1D6 dmg) against one target, whic must save or be [frightened](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Tail Swipe</ins>. The basilisks focuses its gaze on a target while making a melee attack against another target behind it with its tail (1D6 dmg).

<ins>Trash</ins>. Each adjacent creature must dodge or take damage (1D6) and be knocked [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

## So, You Are Hunting Basilisks?

New carousing activities!

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame the Beast</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 5 bags of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Craft from Beast Parts</summary>
Basilisk meat is toxic, but its leather is sturdy, its venom is deadly, but its eyes are the real prize: one can walk through a basilisk’s eye straight to the plane of earth.

A basilisk can be trained from birth to be a mount.

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Eye**. Tiny portal to the elemental plane of earth. If exposed to light will start excreting enough concrete to fill a 5' cube before being clogged.</span>

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Venom.** Drips through stone like it was porous. In food or wound: Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Fail 4 times and die.  On skin: Cures [petrification](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).</span>

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. If you use mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spent at least a bag of gold on it, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.
