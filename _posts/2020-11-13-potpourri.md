**R**: Touch		**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You enchant a potpourri with your sigil. For the duration of the spell, you can touch a diseased thing and trap the malady inside the potpourri. As long as you breathe the potpourri's aroma —through a plague-doctor's mask for example— you are immune to the diseases trapped in it. You can trap [dice] diseases that way.

Alternatively, you can exhale and release one of the trapped diseases and infect the whole hex you are in. For the next [dice] days, [dice]/6 encountered humanoids are infected.
