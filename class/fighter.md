Choose three times: a Weapon of your choice, 12 pieces of Ammunition, a Piece of Armor of your choice.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>

**A:** Weapon Training, Parry <br>
**B:** Tricky <br>
**C:** Outlast <br>
**D:** Double Attack <br>

## Weapon Training
Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you would inflict with them:
- <ins>Blunt:</ins> You can reduce your damage dice by 1 size (1D8>1D6>1D4 etc) and attempt to shove as part of your attack.
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> A prone or suprised target takes double damage.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> When you roll max damage, you can make another attack.

## Parry
You can choose to sacrifice a held weapon or a worn piece of armor to reduce incoming damage by 1D6. If the piece of armor was a shield, reduce damage by 1D12 instead. You can use this ability once per encounter.

## Tricky
Whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 on an attack roll, you can attempt a combat maneuvre on top of the damage.

## Outlast
Instead of taking a Wound, you can take 1 DEX damage.

## Double Attack
You can attack twice in each round.
