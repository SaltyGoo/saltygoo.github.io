*Armored centipede with a chilling breath attack. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. I also love that their breath attacks dont match similarly coloured dragons'. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a centipede as long as a dog, with stone gray legs and a snow covered blue shell with spikes that look like icicles. It eats frozen organic matter.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 2 / 7 / 6 / 1 / 3 / 1  <br>
**Immunities:** cold<br>

Dracopedes cant see well but detects nearby movement. The blue dracopede is well camouflaged in icy environment.

**Attacks:** Each round, the dracopede can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite.</ins> The dracopede makes one melee attack (x).

<ins>Defensive Curl.</ins> The dracopede curls into a ball. As long as it stays in this position, it cannot be damaged by missile weapons and one-handed melee weapons.

<ins>Freezing Spray (recharge 2/6).</ins> The dracopede spits a liquid that freezes very quickly short cone. Those who fail their dodge take cold damage (2x) and are stuck to the floor.

The sprayed ground becomes spiky and slippery.If a creature would fall, it takes damage (x). This attack has no effect in temperatures above the freezing point.

## Salvaging the Body

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.
