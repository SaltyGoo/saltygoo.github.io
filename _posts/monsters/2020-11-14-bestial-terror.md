title: Centaur, Bestial Terror
---

Centaur ghost of doom. A large undead.

_Imagine the ghost of a centaur wearing a terrifying faceless spiked helm. Whenever its hooves hit the floor, it echoes like thunder and black smoke rises from the ground._

_Warmongering bully, overconfident raider, brutish murderer  ._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 3 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast    |   | 

It is **immune** to nonmagical damage, being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it is ethereal), as well as [poison](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and [exhaustion](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it is undead). It doesn't need to eat, breathe, sleep.  
It **can** see in the dark.
**Also**, its hooves make a terrible noise when it gallops. Each creature who hears must save or be [frightened](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). A creature is immune to this effect for 24h after a successful save.
**However**, direct sunlight makes it lose all resistances and immunities.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Charge</ins>. If it has the space to maneuver, the bestial terror charges a target with its hooves and pike. If the target doesn’t dodge, it takes (1D10) damage and is knocked [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Pike Drag</ins>. The bestial terror makes one melee attack (1D8) and may drag the target nearby.

<ins>Trample</ins>. The bestial terror makes two melee attacks (1D6) against different targets.

<ins>Longbow</ins>. The bestial terror makes two ranged attacks (1D6).

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Originally named the bestial beast by its creator [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), the bestial terror is basically a spectral centaur. On top of the spectral trample, I added typical centaur attacks: it was really important for me that the specters were able to drag mortals to the underworld with their pikes. — SaltyGoo
