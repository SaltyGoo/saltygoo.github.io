D: [dice]*10 minutes

Your consciousness leaves your body to take control of a building. This spell can only be successfully cast in the highest, lowest or most central space of a building you have personnaly visited all the rooms. While you inhabit the building, you are aware of the location of anybody within it, can open and close doors, release locking mechanisms, trigger traps, pull levers, see through statues and key-holes, and hear through walls.

The spell cannot be interrupted once it is cast and your body is completely vulnerable. As long as this spell is in effect, your body cannot move or perceive. If you are killed while this spell is in effect, your spirit is trapped within the walls.
