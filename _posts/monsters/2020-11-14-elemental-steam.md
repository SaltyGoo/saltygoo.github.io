| **HD:** X | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal, swim normal    |   | 

It is **immune** to mundane weapons, and being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it's gaseous). 
It **resists** all other damage (because it's an elemental), except electricity.
It **can** shape steam at will, and move through any small hole.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round spent in contact with water.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent in arid locations, and wind can damage it. In general, it has the same properties as water.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Boiling Jet</ins>. The elemental makes a short-range attack (XD4 damage) which ignores armor. A character with a shield, however, can reduce the damage by 1D8.

<ins>Temperature control</ins>. Each creature enveloped by the elemental or its steam takes 1D6 fire or cold damage, which ignores armor.

<ins>Create Steam</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates the equivalent of a 20' cube of steam which lasts X minutes.
