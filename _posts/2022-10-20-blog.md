When I convert monsters for this glog's bestiary, I always try to make them more fun for players and DMs, and one way to do that is to make sure that ther


### Arassas Bile
_Corrosive antifreeze liquid used by [Cat-Dragons](/monsters/arassas) to carve their meandering tunnel-dens through glaciers. Hunters from the mountain clans use chamois leather to scrape leftovers of the substance on the tunnel walls while the dangerous beast is out on hunt instead of attempting to harvest it from its stomach._

<span class="alchemy">**Arassas Bile.** Corrosive liquid (1D6). Prevents freezing, but renders vulnerable to cold damage.</span>

### [Barbazu](/monsters/barbazu) Beard Sebum
This pernicious toxine is used by unscrupulous duelist to ensure that they'll have the upper hand on the second round. Also used in addition to corporeal punishment to keep the wounds visible longer. Readily available in most tyrannical and zealot societies.

<span class="alchemy">**Barbazu Beard Sebum** Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Prevents hit point recovery.</span>

### Basilisk Eye
_Sought after by wizards and masons alike, [Basilisk](/monsters/basilisk) Eyes must be kept hydrated and in the dark at all time and have no powers if harvested more than an hour after the beast's death._

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Eye**. Tiny portal to the elemental plane of earth. If exposed to light will start excreting enough concrete to fill a 5' cube.</span>

### Basilisk Venom
_This deadly venom is prized by assassins for its capacity to be poured through stone, into the kitchen of unfortunate targets. It's even more prized by adventurers wanting a way to free a petrified comrade._

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Venom.** Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Fail 4 times and die. Drips through stone and cures [petrification](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).</span>

### Luck Powder
_The jungle [fruit-fairies](/monsters/aziza) grow strange fruits in the shape of dead tresspassers. When these fruits are dried and grounded, they produce what is colloquialy known as "Powdered Luck". Many adventurers grow apoplectic and terrorized of failure after relying too much on it._

<span class="alchemy">**Luck Powder.** For 10 minutes, you cannot roll below 10. For a session after your first snort, you must carry an aziza on your shoulder (taking an inventory slot). You get two azizas after your second snort, etc. You and fairies are the only ones who can see or hear them. They are chatty.</span>

### Iron Apple Seed
_Grown in the mist along leylines by the mysterious three-armed [athach giants](/monsters/athach) and jealously garded by them, Iron Apple Trees make for an exotic garden feature. Notably, the fruits produced can be smelted to forge [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) weapons tailor-made to kill fairies._

<span class="alchemy"> **Iron Apple Seed**. If planted in hard rock along a leyline and watered, it will grow into a tree producing [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) apples.</span>
