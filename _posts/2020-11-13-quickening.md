D: Sigil

By placing a Sigil on a person or thing, you accelerate its movements, doubling speed and granting two actions per combat round rather than the standard single action. 

The Sigil fades after being used significantly, such as during a combat engagement. After it fades, the person or thing so affected must make a saving throw to avoid falling unconscious or breaking.
