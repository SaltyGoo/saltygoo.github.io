| **HD:** 1 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal     |   | 

It **can** smell as well as it can see.
**Also**, it can be very stubborn. If an attack would reduce the boar to 0 HP, roll 1D6 and reduce the damage by as much.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Charge</ins>. If it has the space for it, the boar charges with its tusks (1D6). A target with Fortitude below 5 falls [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).
