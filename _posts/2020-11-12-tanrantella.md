*Arachnomorphosis*

You dance frantically as if affected by the venom of the tarantella spider. Anyone viewing the dance must save or dance until you stop. Dancing creatures have disadvantage on all of their rolls and gain 1 level of exhaustion per 30 minutes of dancing.

You can protect [dice] other creatures from the effect of your spell.
