## Jaw
You have a bite attack (1D6). Once you have bitten something, you can track it. This ability can be impeded by strong odors.

## Rotten Teeth
Your bite attack does 1D8 damage. A creature bitten by you will be [poisoned](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) the following day unless it receives medicinal treatments.

## Tail
You can attempt to trip or shove all creatures adjacent to you at the same time. Those who fail their save take 1D6 damage.

## Lizard Brute
You can use your tail or bite ability in addition to another attack on your turn.
