Your voice shifts the perspective of [sum] creatures who hear it. They don’t necessarily believe what you’re saying per se, but unless they save against magic, they accept the fundamental premises and values that underly your words, even if those would ordinarily conflict with their own. They have advantage on morale checks so long as they act in accordance with their newfound ideals. Whenever their new ideals drive them into a course of action that would violate their existing ideals, they get another save to end it.
