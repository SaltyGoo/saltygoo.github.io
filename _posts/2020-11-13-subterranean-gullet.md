R: 60’		D: [dice]*10 minutes

All tunnels, pits, and lacunae are the mouths, throats, and visceral spaces of the earth spirits. You may command the instantaneous opening of such a void in stone or rock, either horizontally (as a tunnel) or vertically (as a pit) to a depth of [dice]*10’. The stone slowly returns to its former configuration, and will have closed completely (crushing any within) by the end of the spell.

This spell can alternatively be used to close pits and tunnels, which will reopen slowly. Creatures trapped inside are expelled in the direction of your choice.

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect becomes.
