**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You take the form of an [animal] (of any size or variety) up to your size, including all its natural abilities. You retain your current hit points, attack rolls and saving throws but cannot use any abilities requiring human form such as spell casting.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect lasts 1 day.
