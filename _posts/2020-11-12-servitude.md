**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You prostrate yourself in front of your new master as you give them control over [dice] of your Spell Dice.

Your master can spend these dice on spells as normal, or trade one back to give you a command you can't refuse, which can be to die. You cannot remove this Sigil without your masterâ€™s permission.

This spell is most often cast under duress.
