Tiny tempting devil with a stinger. A tiny celestial.

_Imagine a tiny red humanoid with bat wings, a barbed tail and the face like a commedia dell’arte mask._

_It exists to tell secrets with dire consequences to mortals, with the end goal they will make a pact with a more powerful devil to avoid the consequences._

_Ironic deference, Evil enabler, Coward agility._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal, fly fast     |   | 

It is **immune** to curses. 
It **resists** everything else (because it's a divine servant).
It **can** see in the dark and speak telepathically.
Out of combat, it can cast minor infernal-themed **magic**.

**Also**, whenever a creature the imp can see rolls a fumble, the Imp grows.  It gains 1 HD, 1 Spell Dice, and increases its damage by one dice size.  It also loses the ability to fly and gains the [Maleficence](/2020/11/13/maleficence/) spell.  These changes last until the imp rolls a fumble.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Stinger.</ins> The imp makes one melee attack (1D2) and the target must save or be poisoned by imp venom.

<ins>Invisibility.</ins> The imp becomes [invisible](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until its concentration breaks.

<ins>Shapechange.</ins> The imp transforms into a rat, raven or spider. Its stinger attack becomes a bite attack.

<span class="alchemy">**Imp Venom.** Poison. Save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), save again each day to cure. Increases fumble range by 1.</span>

<summary>Celestial Pact</summary>
Evil celestials give the reward and the quest at the same time, then try to make accomplishing the quest impossible within the decided time frame. Good celestials give a quest first and the reward upon completion. The price of breaking a pact is always your soul.

**Reward:**

1. A red imp follower.
2. A spell scroll with a random spell.
3. A potion of healing.
4. The way to contact a more powerful celestial.
5. A wizard apprentice follower.
6. Tiny goat horns and the ability to cast [Bewitch](/2020/11/13/bewitch/).

**Quest:**

1. Steal a spell from an archmage.
1. Steal the plan for a magical apparatus.
2. Make a pact with a celestial.
3. Graduate first of your class from the academy.
4. Create a new, very powerful spell.
5. Ruin a wizard’s reputation.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Imps have an awkward position in DnD's cosmology as being clearly chaotic agents of order. I love it. I see their goal as being to push people into making bad decisions, and the concept of a bad decision as being lawful in itself. I based this version from the classic DnD imp, but added the fumble twist from [Goblin Punch](/2019/11/triggered.html).</details>
