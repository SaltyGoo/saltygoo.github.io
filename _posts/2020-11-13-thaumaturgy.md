**D**: [dice]*10 minutes

You become impossible to ignore. The environment slightly bends according to your emotions (doors and windows shut close, the light dims, etc). If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.

This spell also allows you to snuff and light candles you can see at will.
