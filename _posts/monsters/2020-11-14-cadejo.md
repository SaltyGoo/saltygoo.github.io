*Drunkard-tracking magical spooky mutt.*

<span class="alchemy"> *In Central American folklore, the cadejo is a goat-dog that protects or kills travelers, specifically drunkards. There's a good, white-furred one, and an evil black furred one. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) gives it weapon immunities and magical powers. What I did was give them standard fairy resistances and a magical attack instead of the spell lightning bolt. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

## Salvaging the Body

Cadejo fur is always oily and shaggy, but is rumored to make the wearer appear dead to undead creatures.

By fermenting cadejo fur oil in a vat, a wizard can create a strong alchohol that will inspired them to create a new spell with the word drunk.
