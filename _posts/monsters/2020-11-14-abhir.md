*Demonic darkness snake that feeds off martial prowess. Aberration*

<span class="alchemy"> *The Abhir is an original DnD monster who only appeared once in [Dungeon Magazine #23](https://annarchive.com/files/Dungeon%20Magazine%20%23023.pdf). It was basically a weaker marilith clone with a darkness spell. When adapting it for my bestiary, I wanted to differentiate it from the marilith for two reasons: first, I find that monster clones cheapen both the original and the creation, and second, I always thought that the marilith looked more like a ruthless devil than a demonic embodiment of chaos. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine slithering darkness. If you could see inside, there’d be a big snake body with tentacles, hooks and a single eye instead of a head.

It wants the souls of strong warriors to feed its larvae. <br>

## Mutation

Your studies of the aberration has changed you in horrible, gruesome ways: you bear the trapped soul of a defeated warrior. It manifests as a chitinous armor on ...

1. ... your legs. 
1. ... one of your arms. 
1. ... your hand, which counts as a one-handed weapon of your choice.
1. ... your chest.
1. ... your face.
1. roll again. You know the [spell word](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spell-words) *Weapon* and gain one spell dice.

That specific body part is immune to fire and counts as armored. You cannot wear equipment on this body part.
