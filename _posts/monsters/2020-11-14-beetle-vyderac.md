title: Beetle, Vyderac
---

Swarming acid-spitting blood-drinking beetles that live in colonies. Each form of vyderac has a specific role, with *Seekers* being usualy encountered first. A beast.

Imagine a grapefruit-sized scarab with a deep red shell and strong, oversized hind legs.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderacs do not see well but can smell vyderac pheromones up to a mile away. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 10’ without momentum. 

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Attach.</ins> The Vyderac jumps on a target. Unless the target succesfuly dodges the beetle is attached to it. A creature can attempt to remove an attached Vyderac twice per round.

<ins>Probe.</ins> The Vyderac injects acid inside its victim with its probe (1D4).

# Vyderac Swarm

**HD:** 0 +4D4HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderacs do not see well but can smell vyderac pheromones up to a mile away. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 10’ without momentum.

In a swarm, Vyderacs are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Attach.</ins> The Vyderac swarm makes a melee attack with reach using its HP as its attack stat (1D4). The damage inflicted is the number of Vyderacs attached to the victim (see above), the swarm loses as much HP.

# Vyderac Seeker

Imagine a cat-sized deep red scarab with atrophied elytra and protruding, oversized abdomen and eyes. It zips quickly and loudly across the sky.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile, but weak otherwise <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderac Seekers detect heat, and are attracted to mammal body temperature.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Pheromone Spray.</ins> The Vyderac sprays a cone of fine yellow powder on one or two adjacent targets. If they fail to dodge, they are covered in Vyderac pheromones which cause urticaria. 1D4 Vyderac swarms will arrive in 1D6 hours, and a Feeder 1D4 turns after.

<span class="alchemy"> **Vyderac Pheromones**. Contact poison. So itchy a sprayed target must save each round until they succeed three times or are washed, during which time they cannot focus on any task that extends beyond 1 turn. If they fail three times, they have scratched themselves until they bled and the poison has entered their body. In 10 minutes, they will be completely paralyzed until they are cured.</span>
