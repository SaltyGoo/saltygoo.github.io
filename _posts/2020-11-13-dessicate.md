R:  30'

Hydrated target within 30' takes 1D6 + [dice] damage, doubled if it's a liquid or gelatinous creature. Can also be used to turn meat into jerky or concentrate water-based liquids (wine, most acids). You can make a cup full of very strong brandy from a bottle of wine. Also destroys [dice] x 5' cube of water.
