R: 90’ 		D: [dice] rounds

You expand or move a flame to cover [dice] 5’ extra squares of flammable surfaces, inflicting [dice] damage every round to anybody caught in it.

Alternatively, you can reduce a fire by the same size, up to a candle light.

At any moment, you can detonate the flames, inflicting [sum] damage to everybody nearby.

This spell can be used to control a fire elemental like a puppet instead.
