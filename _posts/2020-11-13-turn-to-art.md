R: Touch  D: [dice] x 10 minutes

A target who fails a save becomes an object of art for the duration. You can choose the type of art, though it must retain the targetâ€™s equivalent dimensions and evoke its original features. Damage or changes to the artwork are retained by the target when it returns to its base form, but ends the spell.

Investing 4 Spell Dices in this spell makes the duration permanent.
