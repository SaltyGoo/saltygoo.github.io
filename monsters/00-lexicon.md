**Spellcasting:** *Monster spells do not match the players' spell list, but are named in a way for the referee to be able to interpret their effect as they see fit. The goal is to speed things up: teleporting and resurrecting might be dangerous endeavours for PCs, but pretty straightforward for monsters who can do it innately.
Monsters rarely spend more than 3 spell dices on a single spell, and they have as many spell dices as their HD* 

Minor abilities that relate more to how the monster lives live darkvision, keen smell and water breathing are listed in one paragraph.

**Major Abilities:** Abilities that affect combat are highlighted as such.

**Attacks:** Each round, a monster can perform a certain number of actions listed. Of course context might call for new ones at the referee's discretion.

<ins>Actual Attack.</ins> A melee attack hits an adjacent target, a melee attack with reach can hit targets behind others, a short range means within 1 turn of movement, a long range means a lot.
Damage is listed abobe. When an attack has (2x), etc in it, it means the attack does twice the number of damage dices.
