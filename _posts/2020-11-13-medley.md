**D**: [dice] rounds

Spreading outwards from you, the borders between things begin to break down, transforming into inchoate slime, a matrix of colors and angles. Anything nonhuman touched by the Medley dissolves into more of it. Living humans can walk on the Medley without issue, though their equipment will dissolve.

The Medley affects objects worn by you and all adjacent inanimate objects. For the duration, objects in the area of effect functionally cease to exists and creatures count as being naked. You are immune to weapons and can move through walls at a rate of 1 foot per round.

Objects return to normal once out of the area of effect.
