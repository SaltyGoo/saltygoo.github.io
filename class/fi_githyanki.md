*This was initially a monster class for the [ogre](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/ogre), but it could be reflavored as any big hungry bully. It's part of a cycle of classes with the [pigfolk](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/specialist/pigfolk) that explore the fat mechanic. Players taking this class should aim to become as fat as possible. The ogre class is pretty weak when skinny, but has a very high power potential. — SaltyGoo*

## Gith Magic
You can cast spells using Spell Dices (SD) like a Wizard, except that yours depend on your martial prowesses: You gain a Spell Dice every time you sucessfuly damage a creature with a melee weapon. The dices are D6s and last 10 minutes before vanishing. You can only have 3 of them at a time.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary> 
<ins>Casting a Spell</ins><br>
Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. In the case of a Githyanki, the catastrophe takes the shape of a piercing light shining on you from a portal, burning your astral tether and dragging you inside a Mind Flayer nautiloid ship where you are sure to be experimented upon.

## Astral Tether
If you hit something with a silver weapon you can choose to be anchored to it by an astral silver thread. The silver thread is 30' long for each Githyanki template you have, and yanks you back to the anchor at the end of each of your turn without hurting you, even across dimensions. The tether lasts until severed by a silver weapon or until you create a new one.

## Gith Yank
When tethered by your silver thread, you can jump as far as its full length and do one action before being yanked back.

## Dance of Blades
You can make an attack against a different target when you are being yanked back by your tether.

## Silver Sword of Gith
When using a silver weapon, you inflict critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 instead of just 20. You can also cut a limb from the target or banish it to its original plane when you do so.
