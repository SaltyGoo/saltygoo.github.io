**R**: Touch 		**D**: [sum] days

You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask. The rest of the corpse shrivels up and flakes into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face youâ€™re wearing. The mask will rot into uselessness after [dice] uses. If [dice] is at least 4, the mask is permanent and can be used an unlimited amount of time.
