The olitiau is a cryptid from Cameroon described as a giant toothy bat. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) gave it a smaller size (rare!) and made it a disease carrier. Maybe its because I'm writing this in the middle of a pandemic, but I like that diseases become a real threat in DnD.
