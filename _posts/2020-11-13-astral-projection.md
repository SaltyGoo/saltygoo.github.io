D: [dice] minutes

Your spirit is liberated and may venture safely from your body up to [dice]*10â€™ (which remains in stasis while the spirit is absent). The spirit is ethereal (and thus invisible to most mortal creatures), and may pass through a thickness of rock equal to [dice] feet, but is barred by lead or magical wards. 

While ethereal, you may reach into the brains of others to raid surface thoughts, though targets of higher HD than [dice] are permitted a saving throw.
