##### Classic DnD monster.

**Half owl, half bear**. Owlbears are nocturnal solitary beast that eat whatever is available to them. They use their excelent sight to spot movement in the dark. A large omnivorous beast.

_Imagine a large bear, except it has the face of an angry owl and its head and front legs are covered in feathers._

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 4 bags of gold in food while carousing to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Owlbear fur/leather makes very good leather protection. It’s possible, but very hard to domesticate one if you have a cub.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
