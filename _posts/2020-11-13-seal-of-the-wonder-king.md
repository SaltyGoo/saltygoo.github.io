title: Seal of the Wonder King
---
You inscribe your Sigil on an vessel, then circumscribes it by the Seal of the Wonder King. Holding the vessel, you can bind an aberration, celestial, elemental or fey being into the item. Creatures of a level higher than [dice] can attempt a save to resist. If they succeed, the container is simply not fit for that specific creature, but can be used for others.

Once a victim is bound, they can parlay the terms of their freedom: usually a service to be carried out is enough, but more complicated agreements are common. 

Once the victim is let out of the container nothing binds them but the knowledge that you can try to entrap the traitor back in the vessel each combat round until they are trapped again.
