###### A class inspired by A Blasted, Cratered Land's [cleric](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-cleric.html) by Velexiraptor. 

_You have been ordained a **priest of the Church**. The Church is universal across the Empire, united in its worship of the **Authority**. While bishops and cardinals bicker over political and theological issues, local parishes celebrate thousands of different saints, martyrs and traditions._

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Holy Vestments, a Censer, and your Holy Book 
<br> _You need one of each to use your priest abilities_

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
"The Holy Scriptures" and your choice of "Dead Languages", "Preaching" or "Inquisition"

For every Priest template you have, you choose one new **Sacrament**.

## Sacrament
When you choose a Sacrament, you become imparted by the divine grace of the Authority. Each sacrament is different and represents one facet of your faith. If a sacrament gives you a spell, it is stored in your Psyche and you can cast it _once_ between each rest.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
They are D6s and you cannot cast a spell without them. Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). Triples give 3 Points, and Quadruples, 6 points.
