title: Elemental, Steam
---

Sentient steam. A water elemental.

Imagine vapor moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in hisses and temperature changes.

**HD:** X  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** any <br>
**Stats:** average <br>
**Movement:** fly average, swim fast <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As elemental water, the steam elemental *resists all damage* except electricity. It *recovers X HP* every round spent in steam and *takes 1D4 damage* each round spent in arid places. In general, it has the same properties as water. 

As a gaseous creature, the steam elemental cant be petrified or grappled, hit by mundane weapons and can fit into any hole. However, winds can hurt it like a sword. Additionally, the steam elemental can shape steam at will.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Boiling Jet</ins>. The elemental makes a short range attack (XD4 damage) which ignores armor. A character with a shield, however, can reduce the damage by 1D8.

<ins>Temperature control</ins>. Each creature envelopped by the elemental or its steam takes 1D6 fire or cold damage, which ignores armor.

<ins>Create Steam</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates the equivalent of 20' cube of steam which lasts X minutes.
