title: Elemental, Earth

Sentient earth. An earth elemental.

Imagine earth moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in tremors and groans.

_Straightforward, slow, conservative._

| **HD:** X | **Armor:** as plate  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal    |   | 

It is **immune** to being [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). 
It **resists** all damage (because it's an elemental).
It **can** shape earth at will.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round spent on ground.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent not touching the ground. In general, it has the same properties as earth.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Slam</ins>. The elemental makes a melee attack (XD4 damage). It inflicts double damage to structures.

<ins>Sink</ins>. Until the end of its next turn, the elemental or an adjacent creature treat earth as water.

<ins>Create Rock</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates a 5' cube of boulder which it can throw as a ranged attack (XD4 damage).
