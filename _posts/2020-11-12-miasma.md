R: 60’		D: [dice]*10 minutes

Summon [dice] 10’ cube of the poisonous atmosphere of hell. The miasma follows the wind, but otherwise seeks to descend back to its place of origin. Determine the effect randomly:

1. Save or die if breathed.
2. [sum] acid damage per round to vulnerable objects and creatures.
3. Save or burning blindness until treated.
4. Uncontrollable retching which imposes disadvantage and prevents complex actions such as spell casting.
5. [sum] cold damage per round and any killed in the miasma rise as uncontrollable ice zombies.
6. The stench ofchaos requires all within to save or go berserk, attacking randomly any within reach.
