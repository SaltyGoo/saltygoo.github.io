Snake-bearded devil soldier. A divine servant.

_Imagine a humanoid with blue or red skin, goat horns, a lizard tail, and, even more disturbingly, a beard made of hissing snakes. It holds a barbed glaive._

_Barbazus (also known as bearded devils) conscript wayward souls to war against the enemies of the gods. When seen on the material plane, they are often on a punitive expedition._

_Militaristic rigidity, Warmongering fanatics, esprit de corps._

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Barbazus are very cool mechanically with their unique attacks, but also aesthetically, seamlessly fitting christian, Persian and Indian depictions of demons. Sadly, since their first introduction, they have lost most of their magical powers. Compared to [the Monster Manual (5e)](https://5e.tools/book.html#mm), I brought back the spellcasting and tried to give them a sense of purpose besides being army grunts. â€” SaltyGoo
