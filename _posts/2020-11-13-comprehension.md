**D**: [sum] x 10 minutes

The meaning of obscured or indecipherable communications is laid bare. This spell may be used to understand the words of any language or read the true intent of a cyphered missive. Even spirit or animal speech, such as the groaning of clouds or the howling of wolves, may sometimes disclose their secrets. 

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell and inscribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the duration becomes permanent, but, overwhelmed all the signs to interpret, you now always act last in battle.
