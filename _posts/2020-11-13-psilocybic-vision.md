**R**: Touch  **D**:  1 hour

You induce a potent and revelatory hallucinatory state on the target, who gets two saves; the first to throw off any madness or mind-affecting ailments, the second to avoid [sum] rounds of traumatic and violent hallucinations which [confuses](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) the target. The target gains a +/-[dice] bonus or penalty to their saves, divided between both as the caster desires.

If 4 or more dice are invested in this spell, the first save can remove one [trauma](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) from the target.
