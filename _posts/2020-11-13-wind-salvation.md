**R**: 60â€™

This spell can be cast instantaneously when any object or creature falls. You utter a desperate plea for any air spirit to catch [dice] human sized objects falling before they hit the ground. Caught falling objects are then delicately placed on the floor and there is 1 out of 6 chance the generous air spirit will have a favor to ask in exchange.
