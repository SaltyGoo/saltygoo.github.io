Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). If your roll gives you an animal, roll on the [D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) for it.

Forgotten.

For every Mutant template you have, roll a new mutation (from the [aberration](/list/monsters-aberration) list).

**A:** Font of Flesh, Reactive Mutation<br>
**B:** Regeneration<br>
**C:** Evolution<br>
**D:** Gift of Flesh<br>

## Font of Flesh
You (and any creature) can only have as many scars and mutations as their Constitution score. Scars can be mutated over, but not mutations. If you would gain a mutation above your capacity, you explode, inflicting 1D4 damage per mutation to yourself and all nearby creatures. If you survive, you lose all your mutations and you roll on the [D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html).

## Reactive Mutation
You dont have to wait to the end of the session to gain [new scars](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules#heroism--scars) from your exploits. Instead, once per game, you can immediately react to any brush with death and roll on the [D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html). Add that mutation to your scar list: you now have advantage against that specific danger as defined by the Referee.

## Regeneration
You can spend your turn gruesomely regenerating. You heal 1D6 wounds and HP. If you do, roll on the [D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html).

## Evolution
When you gain a new mutation, you can choose to replace an existing one instead.

## Gift of Flesh
You can touch a willing creature and use your regeneration ability on it. Remember they are affected by the Font of Flesh ability.
