**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

To the second sight, spell casters radiate the presence of their known spells and enchanted items crackle with energy or leak glittering seepage. Specific enchantments reveal aspects of their nature visually. Invisible and ethereal things can be seen.

If you also invested 4 [dice] or more into this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the duration becomes permanent.
