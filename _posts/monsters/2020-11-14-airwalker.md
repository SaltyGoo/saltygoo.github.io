Elemental guide to the plane of air. An air elemental.

Imagine a translucent and luminous humanoid dressed in scarves and dancing in the wind. It travels the winds and ensures the safe travels of truly free souls.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile and wise <br>
**Movement:** fly fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As elemental air, the airwalker *resists all damage* and is *immune to electricity*. It *recovers 1 HP* every round spent only flying and *takes 1D4 damage* each round spent not moving.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Plane Shift</ins>. The airwalker and every creature touching it or a creature touching it are transported to the plane of air.

<ins>Punch</ins>. The airwalker makes one melee attack (x). 

<ins>Unshackle</ins>. The airwalker attempts to grapple an adjacent target. If it succeeds, the target is under the effect of levitate.

<ins>Whirl</ins>. The airwalker moves an adjacent thing somewhere nearby.

<summary>Conjuring the Elemental</summary>

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 1 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Aerial Servant** <br>
R: self 

When casting the spell the caster must join hands with up to [dice] people. The airwalker will then ask each participant why they seek access to the plane of air. If the motive is anything beyond personal freedom, the person must succeed a charisma check to successfully lie to the elemental. If everybody passes the check, the airwalker planeshifts the group to the location of their choice in the plane of air.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
I think the airwalker is an orginal creation of  [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I loved it as-is, we dont have enough friendly elemental creatures. To signal the friendliness, I dropped their sword and armor. — SaltyGoo
