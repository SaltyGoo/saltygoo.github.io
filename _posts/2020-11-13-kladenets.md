**D:** Until sunrise

You recite a passage of gratitude (traditionally facetious), and leave a shallow wooden dish containing your blood on the floor of a space you seek to protect. Your [shadow](/monsters/shadow-elven) splits off from you and sups from the bowl. It then lingers in the area, guarding it against intrusion. It has [sum] hit points.

You can give [dice] instructions to the [shadow](/monsters/shadow-elven) regarding objects or people it must prioritize in protection, authorized entrants, and other details. Upon the sunrise, or if the bowl is spilled, the shade dissipates. Some might notice that you lacks a shadow.
