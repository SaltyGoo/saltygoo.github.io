**R**: Touchâ€ƒ    **D**: [dice] days

A willing creature you touch is cloaked with an illusion that makes them appear to be in their physical prime, giving them a [dice] bonus to their charm-related rolls. The illusion may flicker or fade if the target is struck by magic or is Wounded. If you die under this spell, your soul will be in the possession of a vanity devil and you cannot be resurrected.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
