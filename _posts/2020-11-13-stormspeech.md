**D**: [dice] hours

You may command the weather, though only through a [sum]-word command.  Invariably any weather modifications will result in threefold retribution as the skies become enraged by mortal interference and reassert dominance in days to come. Stormspeech is most commonly used for speeding ships on placid seas, as the seafaring sorcerer will likely be far away from the cosmic rebalancing when it comes. 

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent but a [catastrophe](/class/magic-user#spells) occurs.
