_You are the allure of the sea ..._

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Conch, a Foam Shawl (see below), and one Weapon or Tool of your choice stolen from a sailor.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Reef Gardener, Deep Sea Hermit, or Landweller Seducer

For every Nereid template you have, you gain one **Foam Shawl**.

**A:** Fey, Deep Blue, Foam Shawl<br>
**B:** Allure of the Sea <br>
**C:** Dance of the Shawls <br>
**D:** Panthalassa <br>

## Fey
You can shape spells and emotions like clay, but iron makes you [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for 10 minutes upon contact during which you cannot use your powers.

## Deep Blue
You and creatures charmed by you can breathe underwater.

## Foam Shawl
For each Nereid template you gain a Foam Shawl. These shawls are in fact minor water elementals bound to you.

Each shawl knows one Nereid Spell. When worn, you gain a Spell Dice (SD) and can cast the spell known by it. When you expend the SD, that shawl disappears and you lose its effect. You only recover the shawl if you rest submerged in water.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Necromancer template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

You can lend these vestments and their power to other people. However, as long as they hold the clothes, they are [Charmed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) by you.

## Allure of the Sea
You are an embodiment of the allure of the sea. This emotion is stored in your Psyche. Any creature holding one of your possessions also bears this longing. They are now [Charmed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) by large bodies of water and must save to avoid being [Dazed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when seeing one (even a depiction or a vivid description of one).

## Dance of the Shawls
You can awaken your shawls by dancing. Each is a [Water Elemental](/monsters/elemental-water) with 1D6 HP that obeys your command. If one dies, it'll come back to you after you rest submerged in water.

## Panthalassa
In your vicinity, any amount of water bigger than a drinking glass is connected to the global sea, Panthalassa. Thus any puddle is infinitely deep.
