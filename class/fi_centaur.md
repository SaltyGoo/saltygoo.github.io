<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Bow (and a quiver of arrows), a Saddle, and four Wine Bottles.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Mythology, Great Outdoors or Archery.

For every Centaur template you have, you gain 2 extra inventory slots.

**A:** Horse, Hooves I<br>
**B:** Ride or Die, Revelry<br>
**C:** Charge, Mentor of Heroes<br>
**D:** Hooves II, Constellation<br>

## Horse
- Running or jumping is easy. Climbing or swimming is hard. Crawling is impossible.
- You can have one human-sized rider.

## Hooves I
You can attack with your hooves using your Strength. On a hit, the target takes 1D6 damage and is shoved [prone](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) if it is smaller than a horse.

## Ride or Die
You and your rider can take a hit for one another.

## Revelry
You can drink a full bottle of wine in one action. If you do so, you gain 4 temporary HP for 1 hour and make a STR save, if you fail, you are also [poisoned](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for the duration. Any equivalent dose of alcohol works. You can stack this ability as many times as you have Centaur templates.

## Charge
You and your rider's melee attacks inflict an extra 1D6 damage if you charged at least 30' before doing it.

## Mentor of Heroes
Your allies and followers can use your [beliefs](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to heal trauma or gain a new skill when carousing.

## Hooves II
You can make your _Hooves_ attack in addition to another attack each round.

## Constellation
As long as a player character remembers you, your Mentor of Heroes ability is still active. Even if this character dies or is retired.
