R: sight  D: [dice] x 10 minutes

You conjure an intangible, floating eyeball to a point in space that you designate. Unlike most spells, you do not have to have line of sight to cast it. As long as you maintain concentration, you can see through this sensor with your normal senses. This spell requires something to scry on, usually a mirror, quiet pool, clouds, or bonfire. If you invest 2 or more [dice], you can also hear through the sensor (it grows an ear). If you invest at 3 or more [dice], you can also speak through the sensor (it grows a dribbly little mouth).

If you use an actual crystal ball when casting this spell, the range is instead infinite. Crystal balls are rare enough that they are never offered for sale, but are worth a Treasure. Most are ancestral relics.
