Animated stone statue. A large construct.

_A statue made of solid stone. When it moves, it's in simplistic, straightforward gestures._

| **HD:** 5 | **Armor:** as plate  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |

It is **immune** to [fatigue](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), poison and diseases (because it's an object). 
It **resists** fire and magic.
**However**, anti-magic zones and dispel effects paralyze it.

If the golem’s activation glyph isspecifically destroyed, the golem is deactivated. It can be altered to change its order. Roll a D12 for its location:

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
This is a streamlining of Arnold K's amazing take on the [golem](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/golems.html). Traditionally, stone golems have a slow ability, which never made sense to me, so I added a shockwave that allows it to prevent unsuspecting adventurers from running away. — SaltyGoo
