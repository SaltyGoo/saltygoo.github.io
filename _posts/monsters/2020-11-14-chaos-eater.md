##### From Garamondia's [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-optical-dungeonthe-process-dungeon.html)

**Cosmic Insect.** Grown by timeless beings in their squirming billions in the future and then seeded back through the timeline to prune it of its complexities. Sometimes handled by [barbazus](/monsters/barbazu) to sniff chaos. A divine servant.

_Imagine a nine-foot long worm made of a series of chitinous spiked wheels. Its horrible mouth looks like a grinder and it roars like a gregorian chorus._
