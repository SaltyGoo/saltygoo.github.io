D: Sigil

Prepared canopic jars and paraphernalia must be available, loaded with the organs of a person slain in the last [dice] days, and marked by your Sigil before the casting of this spell. 

Using the remains, a ritual of three days and three nights may then be performed that slowly gathers a new body around the soul still contained in the brains and viscera. 

There is [dice] chance out of 4 that the knowledge, self, and memories of the slain person are preserved.

If your Sigil would be to disapear, the new body would quickly start to rot.
