**R**: 60’		**D**: 10 minutes

You unbind [dice] objects smaller or equivalent to a human from the shackles of gravity. You decide the height where the enchanted object will now float by default, up to a maximum of [dice] x 10’. When the spell ends, the object falls gently to the ground if you want.

If you invest 4 or more [dice] in the spell, and inscribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
