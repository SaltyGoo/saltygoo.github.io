title: Gremlin, Gremishka
---

Kleptomaniac house fairy. A fey.

Imagine a pint-sized, furred, cat-eyed humanoid with a muzzle. It moves around at high speed, often passing for a house cat or a rat, but its long fingered hands and feet and oversized toothy mouth betrays its supernatural nature.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** weak, yet agile <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairy, the Gremishka *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, the gremishka can see in the dark and is very stealthy.

Gremishkas are notably allergic to magic. If a spell is cast within 30' of one of them, roll a D3 on this table once:

1. The caster nearly mishaps. It gains [1 Doom Point](/class/wizard#spells).
2. The gremishkas in range grow! They gain 1D4 extra HP.
3. The gremishkas multiply! Add a new swarm of them to the encounter.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite and Scratches</ins>. The gremishka makes a melee attack (1 damage). It then sneaks away nearby.

<ins>Steal</ins>. A target in melee range must save or have a small object stolen from their inventory. The gremishka then sneaks away nearby.

As fairies, gremishkas *resist mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if they touch cold iron, they lose all these abilities and spells for a round. Additionally, they can see in the dark and are very stealthy.

In a swarm, gremishkas are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

Gremishkas are notably allergic to magic. If a spell is cast within 30' of one of them, roll a D3 on this table once:

1. The caster nearly mishaps. It gains [1 Doom Point](/class/wizard#spells).
2. The gremishkas in range grow! They gain 1D8 extra HP.
3. The gremishkas multiply! Add a new swarm of them to the encounter.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bites and Scratches.</ins> The Gremishka Swarm makes a melee attack (1D4) with reach using its HP as its attack stat. If it inflicts 4 damage or more in a single attack, it steals an object from the target.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

There is not much to do with the tiny naked body of a gremishka. Maybe an ugly fur coat could be made with the skin of 30 of them?

A wizard who manages to live in a house infected by gremishkas and ignore them for 7 days straight has the mad inspiration to write a spell with the word _kettle_ in it.

<summary>Credits</summary>
The original gremishka comes from [Ravenloft](https://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/gremishk.html), and like many Ravenloft creatures, it is full of creepy flavor. For once, the [5e version](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/993-gremishka-terrify-spellcasters-with-these-tiny) made them even more interesting, adding OSR-style chaos to them. I tried to stay faithful to both.</details>
