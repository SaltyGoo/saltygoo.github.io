Fear-devouring tumors with your face. An aberration.

Imagine a humanoid face bloated like a balloon, with eight clawed arms below the neck instead of a body. It eats fear and is born from fleshy tumors that grow in areas touched by weird energy. <br>

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy, charismatic and dumb <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As an aberration, the Abysmal *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally since it eats it, the Abysmal can *smell fear*. It can also *see in the dark*.

If the abysmal *glances at you*, the abysmal’s face becomes a distorted version of yours, and you must make a saving throw against fear. On a failure, you are frightened. On a success you are immune to this abysmal’s visage for 1 hour. 

When the abysmal has your face copied, slicing your own face or denying its existence (and losing 1D4 wisdom) kills it. It will come back in one hour.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite.</ins> The abysmal makes one melee attack (1D6). If the target is frightened, the attack is made with advantage and the abysmal is healed by the damage inflicted.

<ins>Claw.</ins> The abysmal makes two melee attacks (1D6).

<ins>Silent Shout.</ins> Roll 1D6 for each frightened creatures within sight of the abysmal. For each 1 rolled, a new abysmal is summoned. They will arrive in 1D4 turns.

I think the abysmal is an orginal creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). When adapting it, I wanted to up the horror factor and was inspired by Junji Ito's short story "The Hanging Balloons" found in "The Face Burglar / 顔泥棒". — SaltyGoo
