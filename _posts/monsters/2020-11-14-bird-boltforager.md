title: Bird, Boltforager
---

A diseases-carrying red carrion bird. A beast.

Imagine a big eagle-sized bird with brick-colored plumage. It has a big beak and a bony ridge that protects its head when feeding. It seems covered in dirty orange dust.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

The Boltforager can smell rotting corpses from a mile away.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Dive Bomb</ins>. If the Boltforager is flying high, it dives down and makes a melee attack (1D6) to try to impale a victim on its ridge.

<ins>Wing Assault</ins>. The Boltforager makes a melee attack as it flaps its wings frantically and scratches its target (1D4). If the target is Wounded, it must save or be infected with parasites.

<span class="alchemy">**Boneforager**. Disease. Symptom: gain 1 wound as the parasite eats your bones. Save every night to avoid adding a cumulative symptom. The wounds cannot be recovered until the disease is removed.</span>

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

The boltforager's beak and bony ridge make a solid, easy to carve material. The dust covering it is full of worm eggs and can be of interest to those interested in biological warfare. Its meat is edible, but must be thoroughly cleansed of the parasites.

Boltforagers are a creation of [Jacob Hurst, Evan Peterson, and Donnie Garcia](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/) found in [Hot Springs Island](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/the-dark-of-hot-springs-island/). The creatures are not statted in the book, so I made my own version. â€” SaltyGoo
