**R**: 60’	

You destroy an enchantment by feeding it to a hekaphage, an ethereal creature that eats magic and curses. A saving throw applies if [dice] is less than the enchantment’s [dice]. There is a chance in 6 equal to the enchantment’s [dice] that the magic drained is sufficient to cause the [hekaphage](/monsters/shadow-elven) to manifest in the material world, though it will be fat and sated with the magic it has consumed.
