##### Classic monster from European heraldry and dungeons and dragon.

**Fire-breathing mountain dragon**. Titanic strength, arrogant intelligence, overconfident charisma. A huge carnivorous beast.

_Imagine a strong looking dragon, with crimson scales, yellow belly and fearsome horns. It loves to display its superiority in everything._

## Encounter

**Number** : 1 <span style="display: inline-block; width:30px"></span>
**Lair** : A menacing cave strongly smelling like sulfur. <span style="display: inline-block; width:30px"></span> <br>

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Loot It</summary>
Dragon scales make amazing armor, and their flames forge the best weapons. Most iconically, dragons have huge hoards. Roll 10 times :

1. Enough gold coins to fill a <a href='/2024/06/26/currency/'>bag</a>.
1. Enough silver coins to fill a <a href='/2024/06/26/currency/'>bag</a>.
1. Enough gems to fill a <a href='/2024/06/26/currency/'>bag</a>.
1. The crown of a kingdom.
2. A <a href='/class/wizard#study'>spellbook</a>.
3. A magical weapon.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
