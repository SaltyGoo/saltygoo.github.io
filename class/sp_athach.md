title: The Three-Armed Giant Baby
permalink: /class/specialist/athach

<span class="alchemy"> *This was initially a monster class for the [Athach](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/athach). In [gaelic folklore](https://what-when-how.com/celtic-mythology-and-folklore/fachan-athach-to-fergus-feargus-celtic-mythology-and-folklore/), the athach was thugish giant with one leg and three arms waving flails made of apples. Its strange appearance was linked to the fear of druid curses. In DnD, it was [boringly adapted](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/gianatha.html) as a three-armed hill giant. Since I want my monster adaptations to be retrocompatible with old modules, I decided to go for a middle ground between generic and weird by pushing the druidic aspect. Finaly, since I dont want my players to play huge monsters, I flavored this class as a human adult-sized baby giant. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

## Three-Armed
You have three arms. Doing different things at the same time with each is clumsy.

## Giant Baby
You are affraid of creatures bigger than you. Save when you see one. 

## Awaken the Laylines
As a baby primeval giant, you are starting to attune to the power that flows through the land. Any room or area you cross has 1/6 chance of being crossed by a layline of power (note them!). The zone must be on the ground floor or below. While you are on a layline, the following effects are activated:

- <ins>Magic overflows:</ins> Everyobody's [Spell Dices](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells) are recovered on a roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- <ins>Life is abundant:</ins> Everybody's death rolls are made with advantage.
- <ins>Your tantrums create shockwaves!</ins> You can attempt to shove anybody in the area from any range.

## Feed the Laylines
If you plant a thing along a layline and come back to it after a day, you get rewarded:

- <ins>A Seed</ins>. The plant has fully grown.
- <ins>A Ration</ins>. 2 HD of local beasts or a swarm of local vermins were attracted to the location. You can give them a 3 word command which they will follow to the best of their ability and without taking reckless risks.
- <ins>Gems</ins>. Most of the area has collapsed.
- <ins>A Weapon and a Fruit</ins>. 3/4 chances to have rusted/rotten away. Those who dont fuse, becoming heavy [cold iron](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) fruits which you can throw (1D6 damage).

## Not a Baby
You are now large, at least 10' tall and nearly as wide. You can still squeeze in 5'x5' corridors, but not much smaller. Your inventory size is doubled. You have advantage on combat maneuvres and can carry two handed weapons with one hand.
