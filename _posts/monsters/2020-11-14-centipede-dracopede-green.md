*Armored centipede with a acidic breath attack. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Dracopedes are original creations of Richard J Leblanc found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I always love more insectoid diversity and really love their abilities. I was less a fan of making them look like dragons, I think their breath attack is a strong enough parallel without having to give them a dragon face. But that's just my personal taste. I also love that their breath attacks dont match similarly coloured dragons'. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a centipede as long as a dog, with brown legs and a moss covered green shell. It eats dead organic matter.

## Salvaging the Body

Dracopedes are highly sought after for the alchemical property of their spit. Their carapace is very hard, but 5 of them are needed to make an human-sized armor.
