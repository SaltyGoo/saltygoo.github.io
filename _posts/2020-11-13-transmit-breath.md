title: Transmit Breath
---
R: Touch		D: [dice]*10 minutes

[dice] creatures need not draw breath to sustain life for the duration of this spell. 

Instead, you inscribe a rune, and the atmosphere around it is magically transferred to the lungs of the creatures selected during the casting of the spell.

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell and use a Sigil, the effect becomes permanent.
