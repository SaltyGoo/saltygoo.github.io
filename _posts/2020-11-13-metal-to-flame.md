title: Metal to Flame
---
**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] rounds

Metal was born of fire and bends to fire. You change a metal object in range into searing fire. The object maintains its mass and shape but scorches for [dice]D4 fire damage to anything touching it when it transforms, and [dice] damage every subsequent turn of contact. If used as a weapon, it inflicts [dice]D4 fire damage,

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](https://saltygoo.github.io/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
