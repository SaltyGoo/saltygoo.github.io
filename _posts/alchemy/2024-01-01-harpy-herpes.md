<span class="alchemy">**Harpy Herpes.** Disease (Body Fluid). When you act like a shitty person, make an easy save, if you fail, you become a [Harpy](/class/specialist/harpy). Save every night to avoid making the save harder. If the save becomes easier than easy, you are cured. </span>

##### Originated by a [Harpy](/monsters/harpy) from [Harpyshaft](http://rememberdismove.blogspot.com/2015/06/harpyshaft-dungeon-adventure.html).
