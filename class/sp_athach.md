## Three-Armed
You have three arms. Doing different things at the same time with each requires hard rolls.

## Giant Baby
You are afraid of creatures bigger than you. Save when you see one.

## Awaken the Leyline
Your kind knows of the primeval lines that cross the world. When you stand on such path ...
- <ins>Magic overflows:</ins> Everybody's [Spell Dice](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells) are recovered on a roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- <ins>Life is abundant:</ins> Everybody's death rolls are made with advantage.
- <ins>You can create shockwaves:</ins> You can attempt to shove anybody in the area you can see from any range.
Ask the referee if the dungeon room or outdoors hex you are in is crossed by a leyline. Unless specified, leylines cross rooms or hexes identified by a prime number. Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

## Feed the Leyline
If you plant a thing along a Leyline and come back to it after a day, you get rewarded:

- <ins>A Seed</ins>. The plant has fully grown.
- <ins>A Ration</ins>. 2 HD of local beasts or a swarm of local vermins were attracted to the location. You can give them a 3 word command which they will follow to the best of their ability and without taking reckless risks.
- <ins>Gems</ins>. Most of the area has collapsed.
- <ins>A Weapon and a Fruit</ins>. They have fused, becoming heavy [cold iron](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) fruits which you can throw (1D6 damage).

## Coordination
Doing different things at the same time with each requires normal rolls.
