<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Black Spellbook, Ink and Quill, And your choice of a Shovel, a Surgeon Kit, or the Skull of your ancestor.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Your choice of Mortuary Cult Embalmer, Renegade Archeologist, Local Occultist, or Mad Doctor.

For every Necromancer template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice**, you can endure an **extra 2 [Wounds](/2020/11/09/base-rules/)** before you die, and, if you have your spellbook, learn a new **[Necromantic Spell](/spells/#necromancy)**.

**A:** Necromantic Magic, The Threshold of Death<br>
**B:** Harvest <br>
**C:** The Three Faces <br>
**D:** Undeath <br>

## Necromantic Magic
Necromancers get a second random spell from the [Necromancy school](/spells/#necromancy) at level 1. You can alternatively choose to learn the [Lichcraft](/2020/11/13/lichcraft/) spell instead.  They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Necromancer template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Every time you gain a _Doom Point_, roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe).

Because you focus on such dark arts, you begin each adventure chased by the Church.

## The Threshold of Death
What is death? Being wounded does not make you fall unconscious and start dying. However, you still die when you reach your Wound limit. You can give yourself 1 [Wound](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) to add 1 SD to a spell you are casting.

This dark magic takes a toll on your body: Medical care can only heal as many Wounds between your adventures as you have Necromancer Templates.

## Harvest
Everytime you rest in a cemetary or the location of a massacre, you can recruit a new [follower](/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html). This follower is a rotting undead and will be hunted down if understood as such by most humanoids. You can resurect them by inflicting a Wound to yourself.

## The Three Faces
Each morning when the sun rises, you choose whether you are Living, Undead, or Dead, with all that implies.

-  If you are living, you can chose what age you have.
-  If you are undead, you heal [dice] when you cast a spell.
-  If you are dead, your undead followers have as much HP as you have wounds.

## Undeath
You no longer die when you reach your Wound limit. Instead you lose a limb every time you would die. Consider finding spare limbs or new bodies.
