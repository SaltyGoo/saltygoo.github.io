Your consciousness leaves your body to take control of a building. This spell can only be successfully cast in the highest, lowest or most central space of a building you have personnally visited all the rooms. While your spirit inhabits the building, you are aware of the location of anybody within it, can open and close doors, release locking mechanisms, trigger traps, pull levers, see through statues and key-holes, hear through walls, etc. You can accomplish [dice] such actions before the spell ends.

As long as this spell is in effect, your body is completely vulnerable: it cannot move or perceive. If you are killed while this spell is in effect, your spirit is trapped within the walls.

If 4 or more dices are spend casting this spell, you can accomplish as many actions as you want.
