R: 30’ 		D: [dice] hours

You animate up to [dice] bodies into either skeletons, zombies or shadows that serve you like puppets. Instead of animating more bodies, you can use one of your spent spell dice to increase the undead HD by 1 or allow it to keep one ability or action from its living body.

You can only give your undeads 1 order per round. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the effect becomes permanent and the undeads become followers.
