For every Priest template you have, you gain one new **Sacrament**.

## Sacrament
When you choose a Sacrament, you become imparted by the divine grace of your religion. Each sacrament is different and represent one facet of your faith. If a sacrament gives you a spell, it functions the same way as a [Magic User](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user) spell.
