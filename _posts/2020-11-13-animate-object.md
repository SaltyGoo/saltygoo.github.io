**R**: 30'

Animate up to [dice] HD of items for [sum] hours or [sum] Hit Die for [sum] rounds. A collection of small items, like a tableful of silverware, counts as 1 Hit Die and acts as a swarm of creatures, bigger objects like tables and armoire have 2 Hit Die. Animated objects follow simple commands and take your words literally.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the object, the effect becomes permanent.
