title: Rite of the Seventh Day
---
D: 1 Week

It’s common knowledge to those versed in the antediluvian rites that each seventh day harbors ill luck, corruption and impurity, therefore it should be spent in a safe place doing as little as possible. One of the few safe acts in those days is to officiate the Rite ofthe Seventh Day, or, go to a place where one is officiated.

The rite takes one hour, and you can grant a special weeklong blessing to [dice] creatures, chosen from the following:

- Reroll one save in the next week.
- Narrowly avoid one dangerous encounter.
- Luckily escape one accident
- Gain some light solace from one’s afflictions.
