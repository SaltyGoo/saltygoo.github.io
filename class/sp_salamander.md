<summary>Design Notes</summary>
*This is a monster class for the [salamander](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/salamander). I base my designs upon Jojiro's [philosophy](https://dungeonantology.com/2020/08/09/glog-class-design/). This class is special because it changes the way environment is perceived: it takes two common barriers for adventurers (fire and metal) and opens them up, while making water a terrifying one. Templates C and D make the salamander a deadly fighter in melee, but it lacks the durability to truly abuse it.*

*The power of this class relies on the interactions between all its abilities: the fire damage boost improves Fire is Art, Metalbending and Molten Molting, and Snatching Tongue is a good way to touch something for more than a round and trigger Fire is Art. â€” SaltyGoo*

**B:** Snatching Tongue<br>
**C:** Metalbending<br>
**D:** Molten Molting<br>

## Fire is Life
Fire and magma affects you like it was water. Water affects you like it was fire.

## Fire is Art
Your extremities (fingers, tongue, tail) can function like a soldering iron. Anything you touch for more than a round takes 1 point of fire damage.

## Snatching Tongue
You can extend your sticky, burning tongue like a frog and grapple objects that are 15' away. If they are not large or anchored, they are dragged to you.

## Metalbending
Metal objects you hold for at least 10 minutes become white-hot. They inflict fire damage and you can bend them as if they were wet clay.

## Molten Molting
After each rest, your magmatic skin molts and you recover one *Wound*. If a creature damages you by making direct contact, it takes 1 fire damage. If you are grappled, you can squeeze out of your skin and escape the grapple. If you do, you lose this ability until you rest again.
