Sentient rug trap. A large construct.

_It is a rug, except that it will attempt to smother people that trigger it_.

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 2 | **Armor:** as leather  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** slow    |   | 

It is **immune** to immune to [fatigue](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [poison](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and diseases (because it's an object). 
**Also**, it is indistinguishable from a normal rug while not moving.
**However**, anti-magic zones and dispel effects paralyze it, and it is vulnerable to fire.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Smother.</ins> The rug of smothering attempts to [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) a target. If it succeeds, the grappled target is also [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [can't breathe](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and takes half the damage the rug would take. Grappled targets take 1D4 damage on each of the rug's turns. The rug can only grapple one target at a time.
