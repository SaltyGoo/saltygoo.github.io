<span class="alchemy">**Chaos Eater Curse.** Chaos is progressively removed from your soul. When you roll above the average result of a D20, substract 1 to the result. Make a save every time you sleep. On a failure, the penalty for being above average increases by 1. That penalty cannot bring you below the average. </span>
