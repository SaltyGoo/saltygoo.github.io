Braincrabs are hermit crabs that live in skulls. A beast.

Imagine a skull, something moves in its eye sockets and eyestalks probe the area. As it sees you, multiple sharp legs unfolds under it.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** weak, feral and stubborn<br>
**Movement:** slow, swim slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Crabs can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, and can breath underwater. They cant see well but detects adjacent movement. Brancrabs are indistinguishable from a normal skull when not moving. They can also jump up to 10â€™ without a running start.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Skullclamp.</ins> The braincrab jumps and attempts to grapple a target. On a success the target is blinded. A missed attack on a grappling braincrab has 1/2 chance to hit the grappled creature.

<ins>Numbing Saliva.</ins> One grappled target must make a save vs poison or be stunned for 1 minute.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

If you are careful to extract the venom glands, the braincrab is as edible as a normal crab. You need as many crabs as there are players to make a day's ration. Many underdark and sea dwelling creatures have learned to coat their weapons in their juices.

<span class="alchemy"> **Braincrab Juice.** Save or be stunned 1D4 rounds. </span>

<summary>Credits</summary>
A creation of [Richard J. Leblanc](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), I adapted the braincrab to be less save or die, and more a slow painful death from a thousand needles.
