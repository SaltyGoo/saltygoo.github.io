<h1>Hex 24 - Ulcaster's Ruins</h1>

*The famed wizard school of Ulcaster once stood here before its destruction by a cabal of jealous wizards from Calimshan two centuries ago. Now, its rubbles cling to the dusty cliffs of this sad barren land.*

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Dried Riverbed</span>

A big river obsiously used to course through this now-barren land. What's left of it is a barren canyon with sunbleached pebbles at the bottom. The ideal location for an ambush. Following the river leads to Firewine Bridge to the East.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Ulcaster's Ruins</span>

Founded by the famous conjurer Ulcaster more than 300 years ago, the famed wizard school attracted students from across the Sword Coast before its destruction by a cabal of jealous wizards from Calimshan. Now, its rubbles cling to the dusty cliffs of this sad barren land. Rumour has it that the ghost of its founder can be seen at night in the rubbles.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Ulcaster's Dungeon</span>

A simple trapdoor hidden among the rubbles of Ulcaster's School of Wizardry leads to the old school's dungeons. Here, dark arcane secrets are [rumoured](https://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/zvq2d9/ulcaster_school_dark_secret/) to exist. Thalantyr of [High Hedge](https://saltygoo.github.io/pages/BaldurHex/17-HighHedge/) might know more about this.
