<summary>Design Notes</summary>
*Inspired by A Blasted, Cratered Land's [cleric](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-cleric.html) by Velexiraptor which I love. I had been using it in my games for a year, sadly my players have a very very low tolerance for complexity and the 3 clerics characters that were played never ended up using the commands feature and I never ended up tracking the disfavors. After months of beating myself for not being a good DM, I had an epiphany inspired by a recent job editing an instruction manual: each domain is a template. Now the class starts simple and gets progressively more complex and hopefully will be easier to assimilate for the players!*

*So how is it different from a wizard? Well, first, not all templates give spells, but otherwise the priest can be seen as a conditional wizard: they can only cast spells when meeting certain conditions. These rules are pretty abusable by design though to encourage reckless fanatical behaviors. I hope to make many more sacraments! Especially to allow making a spell-less priest. These are just the ones that were relevant to my current game.*

*Also I might redo the wizard like that, but instead of sacraments they are different spellbooks!*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Holy Vestments (including Hat), a Censer, your Holy Book

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
"The Holy Scriptures" and your choice of "Dead Languages", "Preaching" or "Inquisition"

For every Priest template you have, you gain one new **Sacrament**.

## Sacrament
When you choose a Sacrament, you become imparted by the divine grace of your religion. Each sacrament is different and represents one facet of your faith. If a sacrament gives you a spell, it functions the same way as a [Magic User](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user) spell but you can cast it only once between each rest.

Choices of Sacraments:
