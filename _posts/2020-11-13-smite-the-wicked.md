R: 120

This spell must be cast in a place where the sky is visible. You loudly proclaim anathema on one sin (Wrath, Sloth, Envy, Pride, Gluttony, Greed, or Lust) that you believe a target is committing. 

If it is guilty of it, it takes [sum]*2 damage as it is hit by lightning or a cleansing ray of light.

If another visible creature in range was more sinful than the target, you take [sum] damage and cannot cast spells for a day.

###### Smite + Sinner
