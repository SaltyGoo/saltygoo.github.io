title: Muttering Serpent
---

Powerful spirit of self-doubt. A large fey.

_You didn't see the snake first, because its mirror-like scales made it blend in the background. Similarly, it's length is hard to grasp: two or three horses long? You don't have time to wonder as you see your own face at the end of the serpentine body, unhinging its jaws as it looks at you._

_Risk averse, Silently strong, Twisted intelligence._

| **HD:** 4 | **Armor:** as chain |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal     |   | 

It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** speak telepathically to eight people simultaneously and read surface thoughts. Because of that, it only speaks in questions and in the voice of the person they are talking to make them doubt and split their group.
**Also**, as a imaginary creature, willpower must be used for attack rolls against it instead of dexterity. Its mirror-like scales make it functionally [invisible](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when it doesn't move. 

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Coils.</ins> The muttering snake makes a [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) attempt. The grappled target cannot [breathe](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and every time it tries and fails to escape, it takes 1D4 damage.

<ins>Swallow.</ins> The muttering snake unhinge its jaw and makes a [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) attempt with disadvantage. A creature grappled this way is completely grappled (all of its limbs are held) and takes 1D4 damage per turn.

<ins>Tail Slap.</ins> The muttering snake makes a melee attack against two targets adjacent to it (1D6). On a hit, creatures with less than 7 fortitude fall prone.

<ins>Spellcasting</ins>. *Suggestion, Mirror Image*.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

Even dead, the head of a muttering serpent looks like whoever is looking at it. It is well sought after by introspective wizards. Its mirror scales are extremely valuable and make extravagant armor, but their invisibility property fades if it is not washed every day.
