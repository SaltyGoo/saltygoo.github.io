**R**: Sight

You must own a skull to cast this spell, if not, it's your head that will explode. You infuse a skull with the unstable spell which explodes into shrapnel when close to the target. As long as it can see the target, the skull will chase it. It flies as fast as a human can run.

If reached, the target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no save. All within 30' of the target take [dice] damage.
