Wailers, also called professional mourners, death watches, rudaalis or moirologists, are hired to ostentatiously display sadness during funerary processions. Their performances amplify the importance of the deceased and help the truly sad process grief.

For every Wailer template you have, you gain a new **Wail** and can target an additional creature with them.

**A:** Strength Through Suffering, Theatre of Sadness<br>
**B:** Procession<br>
**C:** Death Watch<br>
**D:** Banshee
<br>

## Strength Through Suffering
You have +1 HP per [Scar](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) and [Trauma](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) you have (you gain a Scar when you reach 0HP and survive, and you gain a Trauma when one of your companions die. Scars go in your inventory and Traumas go in your psyche).

## Theatre of Sadness
You can cry on cue. On your turn, you can perform a **Wail** and targets who can hear or see you must save or empathically or have their mood shift for this turn. You can target as many creatures as you have Wailer templates with this ability. Mindless creatures are immune. Animals and ghosts don't get a save. This is not a spell, itâ€™s theatre.

### Wails
Wails go in your psyche. You gain one per Wailer template. 

- **Desperate Sadness** <br> _Throw yourself on the ground in despair._ <br> The targets will attempt a reckless action to achieve their higher goal with total disregard for their own safety.
- **Melancholic Sadness** <br> _Throw your empty palms upward and scream at the sky_. <br> The targets will lose motivation in their current higher goal, instead attempting a self-preserving action.
- **Bitter Sadness** <br> _Flog your naked back in penitent submission._ <br> The targets will attempt a cynical action to achieve their ambition with total disregard for hierarchy, alliances or social conventions.
- **Pityful Sadness** <br> _Loudly cry and tear tufts of your own disheveled hair._ <br> The targets will lose all ego and their next action will be made to please someone else they fear or love.
- **Solemn Sadness** <br> _Stand in dignified silence and fiercely ring your bell once as a single tear runs down your cheek._ The targets will attempt to act with the utmost pomp and respect for this serious situation, putting social mores above practicality.

## Procession
As long as you constantly repeat the same **Wail**, creatures who failed their initial save continue to be affected by it without needing to be targeted again each turn. Every 10 minutes you do so, you must save or lose your voice. If you lose your voice, you cannot perform your **Theatre of Sadness** for 1 hour.

## Death Watch
When you see a _named_ character die, you can begin a passionate, loud eulogy. As long as you do so, it is as if the character was still there as a ghost, immortal, immaterial, and acting according to your wishes. You must save every 10 minutes of the eulogy or lose your voice.

## Banshee
Creatures do not get a save to resist your **Theatre of Sadness**. When you die, you become a ghost. This character can now become the follower of your next character or one of your companions. As a ghost, you have no inventory slots and cannot inflict or take mundane damage.
