*Mage-hunting apparatus. Construct.*

<span class="alchemy"> *I encountered two diferent iterations of the amber golem in DnD: the amber statues in the Amber Temple in Curse of Strahdt which are reflavored stone golems, and the monster found in the [Mystara Monster Manual](http://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/golemys1.html) from 2e upon which this adaptation is based. I gave a new name to this version, since its the least generic version fo the two: it was designed to hunt mages, and, contrary to the image we have of golems, its very fast. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a stylized lion or tiger sculpted out of amber. Its semi translucent body casts an orange shadow.

**Resistances:** fire, magic <br>
**Armor:** as plate <br>

Anti-magic zones and dispel effects paralyze the prowler.

The amber prowler is designed like a big cat and can jump 30’ easily. It also has advantage on climbing checks.

When the amber prowler dies, amber shards can be salvaged for a value of 1D6 [valuables](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures).

**Attacks:** Each round, the prowler can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Rake.</ins> The amber prowler makers two melee attacks (x) against a target.

<ins>Pounce.</ins>  The amber prowler makes a running jump on a target. If it fails to dodge, it takes damage (2x) and is knocked prone.

<ins>Capture</ins>. The amber prowler makes a grapple attempt, inflicting nonlethal damage (x) on a success. While grappled, the target cannot cast spells.
