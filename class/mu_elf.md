## Elven Magic
Your spells are stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice (SD) to cast them.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>How spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Elf template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). Triples give 3 Points, and Quadruples, 6 points.
</details>

## Burden of Perfection
When you are ugly, dirty, wet, disfigured, humiliated, etc., all your D20 rolls are hard rolls (_you must roll above 20 to succeed_). The rest of the time, all your D20 rolls are one step easier (hard rolls become normal rolls (>15), and normal rolls become easy rolls (>10)). 

## Noblesse Oblige I
Your superiority comes with the moral duty to help inferior people. You always know the plight of any society you come across. This knowledge is superficial, more akin to a historical footnote, for it is nothing compared to the tragic grandeur of the elves.

## True Shot I
When you hit a target with an arrow, you can cast a spell on the same target at the same time, ignoring the normal range of the spell.

## Noblesse Oblige II
The era of the elves is over. From now on, you can decide at any point to retire this character, even if you are currently playing another one. If you do, you can change the outcome of one situation your characters is experiencing (at the referee's discretion), like a localised divine intervention.

When you do, time seems to slows, a choir of soft melancholic elven voices echo from beyond, and this character appears, bathed in a dreamy light. You save the day, knowingly glance at your companions one last time, and leave for better shores off screen.

## True Shot II
You can use a bow twice during your turn as long as you are not ugly, dirty, disfigured, humiliated, etc.
