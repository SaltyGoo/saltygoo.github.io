*Braincrabs are hermit crabs that live in skulls. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *A creation of [Richard J. Leblanc](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), I adapted the braincrab to be less save or die, and more a slow painful death from a thousand needles. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a skull, something moves in its eye sockets and eyestalks probe the area. As it sees you, multiple sharp legs unfolds under it.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** tiny &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 1 / 4 / 5 / 1 / 4 / 1 <br>
**Armor:** as leather <br>
**Damage:** 0 <br>
**Movement:** slow, swim slow &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Crabs can climb on any surfaces, including upside down, and can breath underwater. They cant see well but detects adjacent movement. Brancrabs are indistinguishable from a normal skull when not moving. They can also jump up to 10’ without a running start.

**Attacks:**  Each round, the braincrab can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Pinch.</ins> The braincrab makes a melee attack (x). If the target is stunned and grappled, it also does intelligence damage (x).

<ins>Skullclamp.</ins> The braincrab jumps and attempts to grapple a target. On a success the target is blinded. A missed attack on a grappling braincrab has 1/2 chance to hit the grappled creature.

<ins>Numbing Saliva.</ins> One grappled target must make a save vs poison or be stunned for 1 minute.

## Salvaging the Body

Crabs are delicious. You need as many crabs as there are players, or one giant crab to make a day's ration.
