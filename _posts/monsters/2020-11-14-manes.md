What's left of a devoured soul. A small aberration.

_Imagine a pink, hairless obese kid with short legs and long skinny clawed arms. Its mouth has rows upon rows of tiny sharp teeth._

_Like a desperate, evil toddler. The food of eldritch horrors._

| **HD:** 0 +3D4HP | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** special  |
| **Move:** slow     |   |

In a swarm, creatures are **immune** to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and **resist** weapon damage. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Additionally**, when the manes swarm takes weapon damage in melee, it spills acidic bile inflicting 1D4 damage to its attacker and itself.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Claws.</ins> To dodge a swarmâ€™s attack, the roll has to beat 10 + the swarm's HP. On a hit, the target takes 1D4 damage.
