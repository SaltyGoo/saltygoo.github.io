The slow, methodical conversion of more than 9000 monsters from DnD history to the GLoG.

## By Monster Type
I classify monsters in 8 thematic categories with some mechanical common thread, because I love when players can learn:

### Aberrations
Eldritch horrors and mutants. The chaotic demons of DnD are aberrations.

The alien weirdness of aberrations makes them all resistant to mind attacks. As true horrors, mortals need to succeed on a save vs fear to kill one, or have a platinum weapon.

Each aberration has a mutation table for when players want to try to harness their eldritch power.
