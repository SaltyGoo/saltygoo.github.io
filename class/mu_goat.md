_There is something off with you ..._

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
None. You're a goat.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Goat life.

For every Goat template you have, you gain a **Spell Dice** and attract a new person into your **Witch Coven**.

**A:** Goat, Witch Coven, Dark Omen<br>
**B:** Dark Presence<br>
**C:** Bargain with the Devil<br>
**D:** Black Mass<br>

## Goat
You are a goat. You cannot use objects. You cannot talk, except telepathically with witches in your coven.

## Witch Coven
You gain a new Witch follower. Each Witch has 2 hit points, knows a random spell and has [something extra](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). They use your Spell Dice to cast spells. When you would take damage, one of your witches nearby can sacrifice themself to take the hit instead of your goatly majesty. If one of your witches dies, you need to spend a night in a settlement to attract a new one.

<summary>How spells work</summary>
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Goat template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe). Triples give 3 Points, and Quadruples, 6 points.
</details>

Your Witches suffer the consequences of the catastrophes caused by your spells instead of you.

## Dark Omen
You can cause a minor horrible omen to appear. Statues weep blood, ashes spell out “DOOM”, a bird falls out of the air dead, small children sing eerie songs, etc. Can’t deal damage or provide some handy secondary benefit, like triggering a trap, but it will probably scare the bejesus out of someone.

## Dark Presence
If one of your witches is nearby and you are in a dark spot, you can take 10 minutes to cease existing, except for your red eyes glowing in the dark. You can take another 10 minutes to fade back by walking from the shadows, from behind a tree, from tall grass, etc. as long as one of your witches is nearby.

## Bargain with the Devil
Once per day, you can appear as a naked goat-headed humanoid and speak for 3D6 minute, but only to one person (others still see you as a goat). If you convince this person to willingly give you something, you can use your dark presence to manifest once 3D6 minutes near them when they are alone in the future. If your rolls are 6, 6 and 6, you can take over their body, otherwise you can keep bargaining.

## Black Mass
You can have as many witches as you can have followers and use your Bargain form as much as you want. When you rest outside, you can roll a D6 for each of your witches. You gain an extra SD the next day for each 6 rolled, and lose a witch for each 1 rolled.
