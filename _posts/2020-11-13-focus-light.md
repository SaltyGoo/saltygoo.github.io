**R**: sight

Focus all the light around you into a single point.  

- If it is during the day or near a powerful magical light source, it does [sum] + [dice] fire damage and the target must save or be [blinded](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for a round.  
- If it is during a starry night or in the astral sea, it does [sum] mind damage and the target must save or be [frightened](/2020/11/09/base-rules/).  
- At all other times it does [dice] fire damage and the target must save or be [dazed](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) for a round.
