**R**: Touch

You imbue [dice] creatures with unnatural energy, gifting them the benefit of a poor night of rest: they will recover from exhaustion but magic users will not recuperate their lost Spell Dices. Each of them gain [dice] temporary hit points, but will take [dice] points of damage the next time they wake up from a real rest.
