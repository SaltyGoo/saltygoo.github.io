**Attacks:** Each round, the rug of smothering can perform this action:

<ins>Smother.</ins> The rug of smothering attempts to grapple a target. If it succeeds, grappled target is also blinded, restrained, cant breathe and takes half the damage the rug would take. Grappled targets take damage on each of the rug's turns. The rug can only grapple one target at a time.
