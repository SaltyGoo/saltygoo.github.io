# Pallonia, Contemplating Nun
<span class="alchemy">She's sitting on a rock, contemplating the waves. Thin, long teeth, blue eyes. Her nun habits are weathered and too big for her. She sees the future.<br><br>*"I know why you're here. It's the same reason everyone else comes to see me, and you shall get the same answer..."*</span>

<ins>The Problem</ins> - There are much bigger, cosmic forces at play than local conflicts between bandits and merchants, and nobody is acting on them. The children of a god is roaming the area, bringing chaos in its wake and nervousness in the heaven!

<ins>Wants</ins> -- Acknowledgement of the cosmic disturbance, or alternatively be left alone.

<ins>Hates</ins> -- Mundane questions, petty questions, selfish questions.

<ins>Quirk</ins> -- She thinks on a broader scale than you. She never stops contemplating the waves.

<ins>Stats</ins> -- As a *Diviner*.


<ins>Note</ins> -- Use Pallonia as a tool to inform the players on how close they are to resolving the intrigue of **Sarevok**, **Imoen** and **Irenicus**.
