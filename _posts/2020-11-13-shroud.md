**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You become invisible to mortal creatures but appears as a blazing beacon to those with the second sight and many natural denizens of the spirit world like [celestials](/list/monsters-celestial) and incorporeal creatures. 

While shrouded, you exist partially in both worlds, and may be harmed in either. Willing spirit creatures may be brought into the material world with you when the spell ends.
