Vengeful, murderous household objects. A construct.

Imagine any object. Any one. Some have absorbed the negative emotions surrounding them, and over time, have become sentient. All an animus wants is to protect the sad, bitter person that involuntarily created it. In the most twisted, petty way.

The animus’s stats depend on its size : # = 4 (tiny), 6 (small), 8 (medium), 10 (large). For animi bigger than large, create each parts of it as a separate, smaller animus.

**HD:** #/2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, intelligent, charismatic, and immobile <br>
**Movement:** special <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As a construct, the Animus can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue, fear, poison and diseases*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, its wickedness causes any creature *attempting to mentally communicate* with an Animus to be charmed if they fail a saving throw.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Motive Force (recharge 2/6).</ins> The animus animates itself, doing 1 action that would be realistic if it was handled by a human. This is the only way the animus can do a physical attack (1D#).

<ins>Spellcasting (#).</ins> Thaumaturgy, +# spell words

<summary>D10 Animus Spell Words</summary>

The animus knows a certain amount of spell words which it can combine in pairs to create spells. You can add other words to match the nature of the object, like *fire* for an oven, *music* for a piano, or *blood* for a knife.

I fucking love Ravenloft's [animators](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/animatgr.html), just not their name. How fun is it to run a murder mystery where the weapon is the actual murderer. What is the motive? the negative emotions of a bitter person. It just runs itself. In extreme cases, a whole house and all its furniture can be made an animus, creating a quick, funhouse dungeon. — SaltyGoo
