<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Club, 2 Rations and a Big Pot.

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Smashing and your choice of Food, Goblins or Bullying.

For every Ogre template you have, you grow 1â€™ tall and wide, giving you an extra Inventory slot filled with **Fat**.

**A:** Bulk, Smash<br>
**B:** Big, Bully<br>
**C:** Lunch<br>
**D:** Pantagruel<br>

## Bulk
For each inventory slot you have taken by **Fat**, increase your HP by 1. 

You can eat any object bigger than a chicken and softer than iron as a ration. Each time you [carouse](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) and each time you eat at least 10 rations before resting during an adventure, you gain one layer of **Fat** in your inventory.

If you eat less rations in a day than the number of layers of **Fat** you have, you lose 1 layer of **Fat**. **Fat** cannot be removed otherwise.

## Smash
Bludgeoning weapons have their damage die increased by 1 size when used by you, and again for every 5 inventory slots filled with **Fat**.

Damage dice scale this way : 1D4 < 1D6 < 1D8 < 1D10 < 1D12 < 2D6 < 2D8 < 2D10 < 2D12 < 3D8 < 3D10 < 3D12 < 4D10

## Big
You can carry as many bulky items as you have Ogre Templates without them taking an inventory slot. A bulky item is anything bigger or heavier than an average human adult.

## Bully
Once per encounter, you can give a one-word command to a humanoid that is smaller than you. The creature can choose to fall prone instead of obeying the order. You can still do other actions during your turn.

## Lunch
You take half damage from the last thing you ate and, if it was an object, your rolls to destroy things like it are easy. If it was a magical item, you gain its powers.

## Pantagruel
You can eat and digest anything softer than diamond as a ration. You can fill your [Psyche](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) with **Fat**.
