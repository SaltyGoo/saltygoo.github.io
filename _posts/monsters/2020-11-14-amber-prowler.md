---

Mage-hunting apparatus. A construct.

Imagine a stylized lion or tiger sculpted out of amber. Its semi translucent body casts an orange shadow.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, agile, and sturgy, but dumb and unemotive <br>
**Movement:** fast <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

**Spellcasting:** *Locate Creature*

As a construct, the Amber Prowler can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue, fear, poison and diseases*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, the Amber Prowler is *resistant to fire and magic* and, since it is designed like a big cat, it can easily *jump 30'* and *climb* most surfaces.

When it dies, it crumbles and leaves behind 1D6 [valuable](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) chunks of amber.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Rake.</ins> The amber prowler makers two melee attacks (1D8) against a target.

<ins>Pounce.</ins>  The amber prowler makes a running jump on a target. If it fails to dodge, it takes damage (2D8) and is knocked prone.

<ins>Capture</ins>. The amber prowler makes a grapple attempt, inflicting nonlethal damage (1D8) on a success. While grappled, the target cannot cast spells. 

<ins>Detect Magic.</ins>  The amber prowler detects all sources of magic in sight.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
I encountered two diferent iterations of the amber golem in DnD: the amber statues in the Amber Temple in Curse of Strahd which are reflavored stone golems, and the monster found in the [Mystara Monster Manual](http://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/golemys1.html) from 2e upon which this adaptation is based. I gave a new name to this version, since it is the least generic one fo the two: it was designed to hunt mages, and, contrary to the image we have of golems, its very fast. â€” SaltyGoo
