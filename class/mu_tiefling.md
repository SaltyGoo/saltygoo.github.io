<ins>Perk</ins><br>
Any time you would roll for a new spell when you level up, you can roll 1D6 on the infernal perks list instead:

1. Choose two [damage types](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#damage-types), you resist one of them and take double damage from the other.
1. Your eyes glow like candlelight. You can see as if you were holding a torch. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, choose a color: you can see it in the dark.
1. You can hold a something with your tail. It has a Strength score of 1. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, increase its Strength score by 1.
1. When you wield a melee weapon, it inflicts 1D4 extra fire damage. On an attack roll of 1, a nonmagical weapon burns or melts. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, increase the dice size by 1.
1. Once per game, you can fly 60'. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, you can fly an extra time per game.
1. You have minions in one settlement of your choice. Each time you spend time carousing there, you can recruit one fanatical hireling for free. If they are near you, one can sacrifice themselves to protect you from 1D8 points of damage. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, you can either add a settlement to your cult, increase the number of free hirelings in one settlement, or increase the damage prevented by a minion's sacrifice by one dice size.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
You have horns, vestigal wings and a tail: you cannot wear armors and helmets that are not custom made. God-fearing creatures always hate you unless you roll charisma, in which case they fear you.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- You can speak backward, a language only understood by exorcists and divine creatures.
- Hearts are like cocaine to you. When you eat a fresh heart, you gain advantage on any roll as long as it is for a selfish, cocky and petty action for the next hour. For the following hour, you have disadvantage on all rolls that are not for  a selfish, cocky and petty action.
- You cannot be burned by flames smaller than a bonfire.
