##### Inspired by the [The Monster Overhaul](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2023/02/osr-monster-overhaul-megapost.html) night hag and the witch found in the [Deep Carbon Observatory](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/312481/deep-carbon-observatory-remastered).

Curse-brewing, children-eating crones. Hideous inside and out. Misery aesthete. Patronizing familiarity. Hags are often seen with _[Flocks of Birds](/monsters/bird)_ and other [Beasts](/list/monsters-beast). A fay.

<span class="alchemy">_Have you ever shielded your broken heart with a cocoon of bitterness? This distorted hunched woman wrapped in dark shawls embodies that. It corrupts souls._</span>

It has 9 lives and is **immune** to all the things that killed her. Roll 1D8 to know how many time it has been killed.
It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** smell as well as it can see and give itself the illusory appearance of any person.
Out of combat, it can cast scrying and witchcraft-themed **magic**.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Loot It</summary>
Hags care little for money, but they always carry baubles, occult trickets and ingredients. Roll 4 times on the following list.
 
1. Nothing
2. A [potion](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-perfect-potion-list.html).
3. Someone's family jewel worth a purse of gold coins.
4. A (1) hand, (2) eye, (3) ear or (4) tongue in a jar. Still functional.
5. A vial with a substance from the [beast apothecary](/list/apothecary).
6. A human-skin scroll with a [cunning craft spell](/spells/#cunning-craft).

Also, [warts](/2024/01/01/hag-warts/) from a hag are valued by witches and alchemist.
