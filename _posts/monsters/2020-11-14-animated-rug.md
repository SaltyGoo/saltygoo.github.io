title: Animated Object, Rug of Smothering
---

Sentient rug trap. A construct.

It is a rug, except that it will attempt to smother people that trigger it.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, clumsy, inept <br>
**Movement:** slow <br>
**Morale:** mindless <br>

As a construct, the Rug of Smothering can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue, fear, poison and diseases*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, because of its textile, the Rug of Smothering is *vulnerable to fire*. It is otherwise indistinguishable from a normal rug.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Smother.</ins> The rug of smothering attempts to grapple a target. If it succeeds, grappled target is also blinded, restrained, cant breathe and takes half the damage the rug would take. Grappled targets take 1D4 damage on each of the rug's turns. The rug can only grapple one target at a time.
