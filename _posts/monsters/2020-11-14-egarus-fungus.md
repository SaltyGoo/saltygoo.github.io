title: Egarus Fungus
---

Antimatter mold. A plant.

Imagine a spongy white shapeless mold that floats mid air. Everything around it is gone, disintegrated.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** sturdy, sticky and barely conscious<br>
**Movement:** static<br>
**Morale:** mindless <br>

Because it consumes everything it touches, the fungus is immune to physical damage. As a plant, the egarus fungus cant see, hear, be stunned or dazed. However it detects matter in its vincinity. 

The fungus is entirely sticky. It gets stuck to anything it touches and a strength roll is required to remove it (It will be stuch to the thing that removed it). Any damage it takes while stuck on a creature is also taken by the creature.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Process</ins>. The fungus does the first action in this list it has a valid target for, in this order:
- *Absorb Magic*. The fungus ends one magical effect or property on its attachment. It has 1/6 chance to duplicate.
- *Consume Object*. The fungus consumes 1 object (max 5’) it is attached to. It has 1/6 chance to duplicate.
- *Consume Organism*. The fungus inflicts (5D6) acid damage to the creature it is attached to. 1/6 chance to duplicate.
- *Attraction*. The fungus sticks itself to the closest object it can percieve.

<summary>Credits</summary>
Egarus fungi are a strange [Planescape monster](https://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/e/egarus.html) it was very fun to adapt such a deadly a weird creature. I simply streamlined it and opened more opportunity to deal with it creatively: the original was only affected by a handful of specific spells.  — SaltyGoo
