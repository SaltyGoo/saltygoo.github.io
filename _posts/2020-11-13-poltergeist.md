D: Sigil

[dice] poltergeists are summoned to haunt a place or possession, which must be marked with a Sigil. While alone, the phantoms will do their best to harass and torment any living creatures other than you. 

Though the poltergeists cannot talk and are insubstantial, you can direct them to laugh insanely, become visible as ghostly menaces, howl discordantly, and cause telekinetic mischief, which may include the hurling of heavy or sharp objects, though the referee should decide exactly what the poltergeists do.
