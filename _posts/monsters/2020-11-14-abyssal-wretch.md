Terminally mutated humanoid. An aberration.

Imagine a humanoid so mutated and corrupted that it looks like its constantly melting. It has no feelings, only maddening pain.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>

As an aberration, the Abyssal Wretch *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally, its constant mutating allows it to heal all its hit points at the beginning of its turn if its not dead.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite and Claws.</ins> The wretch makes a melee attack (1D4).

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Abyssal wretches from [Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes](https://5e.tools/book.html#mtf) bring to DnD the trope of the demon-infected mutant-zombies which have been popular in Sci-Fi video games since at least Doom. I wanted to make them different than undead zombies by giving them extreme regeneration. I added the hulk variant as an homage to my favourite spin on the mutant-zombie trope: Halo's [Flood Carrier](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Flood_Carrier_Form). â€” SaltyGoo
