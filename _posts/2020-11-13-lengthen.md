**R**: Touch  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

Target body part or object no bigger than a leg increases in length up to twice its length. If the target is part of a creature, they may save to negate this. 

If 4 or more [dice] are invested in this spell and you inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on the target, the effect becomes permanent. You do not need to inscibe your sigil if the target is yourself.

###### increase + length
