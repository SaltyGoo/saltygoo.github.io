**D**: [dice] rounds

You use water like a network of wormholes and travel quickly across it. When you move on your turn, you can instead enter a body of water and come out from any other point you have seen in it this day.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](https://saltygoo.github.io/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
