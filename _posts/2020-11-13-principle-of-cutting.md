title: Principle of Cutting
---
R: Touch  D:  10 minutes

You enchant a bladed weapon to cut materials harder than it. Ignore any hardness, damage reduction, or resistances of materials you cut.

 At 1 [die], you can cut steel as easily as flesh. At 2 [dice], you may cut through magical materials or enchanted items with ease. Adamantine splits like wood. At 3 [dice], you may attempt to sunder force effects (magical barriers such as wall of force). At 4 [dice], you may attempt to destroy artifacts.
