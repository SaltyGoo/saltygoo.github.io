## Scrounge
Once per session, digging through trash, you can get an item rolled on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html) table.

## Specialist
You dont need to roll on skill checks, as you are an expert.

## Incredible Feat
You can achieve things beyond the scope of your skills:

- If you are skilled in **Climbing**, you can climb any surfaces, even upside down.
- If you are skilled in **Disguises**, you may declare that you are leaving the area then later declare yourself to have been one of other minor NPCs present all along, friend or enemy. You can also just walk back in undisguised.
- If you are skilled in **Lying**, once per session, you can redo your turn if you are unhappy with the consequences.
