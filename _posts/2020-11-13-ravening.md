**R**: 30’ 		**D**: [dice]*10 minutes

The growth processes of [dice] animals are accelerated, inducing ravenous hunger. 

If sufficient food is not available, the creatures will attempt to consume anything nearby, and will gain sustenance from materials not normally consumable, such as wood or dirt, though food or flesh is preferred. Roll a D6 for each animal targetted: 

1-4. Double in size for the duration of the spell and then collapse into unconsciousness afterwards. <br>
5. Double in size permanently. <br>
6. Grow until they become gargantuan and are driven insane.
