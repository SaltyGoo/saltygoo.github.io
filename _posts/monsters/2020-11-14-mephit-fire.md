<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Harness Its Energy</summary>
If you have captured this elemental, you can spend the equivalent of 1 [bag of gold](/2024/06/26/currency/) in a magical laboratory between two adventures to bind it to your soul. If you do so, you ...

- You gain 1 [Doom Point](/list/spell-catastrophe) (roll for Catastrophe); 
- You gain 1 [Spell Die](/spells/) and learn the spell _Conjure Flame Mephit_ (below);
- Roll a D6, you <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Permanent mutations take an inventory slot">mutate</span> in the following way :

1. Every flammable item currently on you turns into ashes.
1. Your words are replaced by tiny fire mephits that mime them before being snuffed.
1. Your hair becomes flames (it doesn't burn you).
1. Each time you rest, one thing near you is stolen by a mephit and brought to the plane of fire.
1. Water burns you like it was fire.
1. You can change one word from a class ability you have or a spell you know to *Flame*.

If you roll a Catastrophe, the elemental is released and hostile, and you lose the Spell Dice.

**Conjure Flame Mephit** <br>
R: self 

When casting the spell you must prepare a message with up to [sum] words. [sum] fire mephits are then summoned and will each deliver one word of your message to whoever it is intended to, across any plane. The message will be delivered in the most passionate and destructive way possible, damaging [dice] things the target owns.
