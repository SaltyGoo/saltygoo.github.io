<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Choose three times: a Weapon of your choice, 12 pieces of Ammunition, a Piece of Armor of your choice.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Imperial Infantry, Imperial Navy, Dashing Noble, or Caravan Life.

For every Fighter template you have, you gain 1 **Grit**.

**A:** Weapon Training, Parry <br>
**B:** Battle-Hardened Aura, Platoon <br>
**C:** Battle Tricks <br>
**D:** Weapon Mastery <br>

## Weapon Training
You can use either your Strength or your Dexterity for your melee attack rolls. When you miss a melee attack, your target still take as much damage as your Grit.

## Parry
Once per battle, you can destroy a weapon or a shied you are holding to protect yourself or an adjacent ally from an attack's damage. 

## Battle-Hardened Aura
You project an intimidating aura that lets people know you are a skilled warrior. At any moment, you can decide how weak creatures react to you: they either avoid fighting you at all costs, or gang up on you, ignoring your teammates. Weak creatures are any monster less HP than 4 times your Grit.

## Platoon
Your leadership is legendary. Your followers have a bonus HP equal to your Grit and they share your starting skill (infantry, navy, nobility, or caravan).

## Battle Tricks
Your weapons have different effects depending on the type of damage you inflict with you hit them with an attack:
- <ins>Bludgeoning:</ins> Weak creatures are knocked [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> Weak [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or surprised _unnamed_ creatures are killed.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> You can inflict as much damage as your Grit to another adjacent target.
- 
## Weapon Mastery
You make two attacks per turn.
