*Brain-eating, thrall-making flying octopuses.*

###### Aberration. Adapted from [the Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium)

Imagine a flying octopus, with a bulging, pulsing brain and two very human looking eyes.

It seeks different able bodies to use as disposable labor to build their empire. Multiple digits are highly valuable. <br>

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 5 / 7 / 6 / 4 / 6 / 3 <br>
**Resistances:** mind <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D4 <br>

The brain-bat can breathe underwater and see in the dark.

The brain bat can talk telepathically, but only knows its own language and the ones known by the body it is controlling. Due to its partial understanding of personality, its face always reveals its true intentions.

**Aberration:** To kill an aberration, one must succeed on a save vs. fear. On a failure, it survives with 1 HP.

**Attacks:** Each round, the brain-bat can perform this action:

<ins>Drill Brain.</ins> The brain-bat attaches itself to an adjacent target. If the target fails a saving throw, it takes intelligence damage (x). At 0 intelligence, the target becomes a zombie enslaved to the attached brain-bat, who also gains its knowledge. An attached creature takes half the damage the brain-bat takes.

The brain-bat can take control of dead bodies in the same way.
