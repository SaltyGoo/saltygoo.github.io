A strange hat, ink and quill, a spellbook (see below)

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of "University Graduate", "Alchemist", "Charlatan" or "Forbidden Knowledge"

For every Wizard template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and you **Study**.

## Spells
Wizards get a [random one](/list/spells) for free at level 1. They’re stored in spellbooks and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.

<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary> 
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Wizard template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

## Study
You need a Spell book to study. You cannot take a Magic User template if you do not possess a spell book. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again. You can spend a Treasure when you end a session in town to study again.
