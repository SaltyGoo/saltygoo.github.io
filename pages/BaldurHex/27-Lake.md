<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Bear River Mouth</span>

The salmon-rich waters of the Bear River end end their course here after cascading down from the Cloud Peaks. The pebble beaches that form the mouth of the river are the only location between Amn and Baldur's Gate where access to the Sea of Swords is not complicated by jagged cliffs.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Archaeological Site</span>

The scholar Charleston Nib has set up camp here to dig up a very ancient shrine believed to be to Kozah, an ancient god of destruction. Tension is high among the diggers as rumours of an ancient curse falling upon them are starting to take hold.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Massacre Site</span>

The mangled remains of travelers are strewn around in a gruesome display of violence. A blood-covered man holding a jagged sword heaves in the middle of the carnage. Could it be Captain Brage of the Amnian Army?
