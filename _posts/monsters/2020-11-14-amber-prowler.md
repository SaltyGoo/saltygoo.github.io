| **HD:** 4 | **Armor:** as plate  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fast    |   | 

It is **immune** to immune to [fatigue](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [poison](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and diseases (because it's an object). 
It **resists** fire and magic.
It **can** climb most surfaces like a cat and jump 30'.
**However**, anti-magic zones and dispel effects paralyze it, and, when it dies, it crumbles and leaves behind 1D6 chunks of amber ([valuable treasure](/2020/11/09/base-rules)).

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Rake.</ins> The amber prowler makes two melee attacks (1D8) against a target.

<ins>Capture</ins>. The amber prowler makes a grapple attempt, inflicting nonlethal damage (1D8) on a success. While [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), the target cannot cast spells.

<ins>Detect Magic.</ins>  The amber prowler detects all sources of magic in sight.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
I encountered two different iterations of the amber golem in DnD: the amber statues in the Amber Temple in Curse of Strahd which are reflavored stone golems, and the monster found in the [Mystara Monster Manual](http://www.mojobob.com/roleplay/monstrousmanual/g/golemys1.html) from 2e upon which this adaptation is based. I gave a new name to this version, since it is the least generic one of the two: it was designed to hunt mages, and, contrary to the image we have of golems, it's very fast. â€” SaltyGoo
