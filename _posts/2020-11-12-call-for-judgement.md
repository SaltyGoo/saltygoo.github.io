**R**: 60â€™        **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You need to name a code of law or a contract in your inventory to cast this spell. A celestial spirit of judgement in the shape of a spherical amalgamation of wings and unblinking eyes is summoned from above the target. For the duration, everything within its sight will be forced to follow the named law or contract to the letter. The spell ends if the entity is killed. It has [sum] HD, resists all damage.

If the spell provokes a semantic loop, or a contradiction, it fails and a [catastrophe](/list/spell-catastrophe) is triggered.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent.
