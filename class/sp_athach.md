###### By SaltyGoo. This is a monster class for the [Athach](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/athach). A monster class must be the first class you take. Ask your referee if the monster exists in their world, or you could just have met one in one of your previous adventures.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Iron pacifier, pelt blanket, giant rattle (hammer). 

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Screaming, your starting weapon.

For every Three-Armed Giant Baby template you have, increase your HP by 2 and you grow 1'.

**A:** Three-Armed, Giant Baby<br>
**B:** Awaken the Laylines<br>
**C:** Feed the Laylines<br>
**D:** Not a Baby<br>

## Three-Armed
You have three arms. Doing different things at the same time with each is clumsy.

## Giant Baby
You are affraid of creatures bigger than you. Save when you see one. 

## Awaken the Laylines
As a baby primeval giant, you are starting to attune to the power that flows through the land. Any room or area you cross has 1/6 chance of being crossed by a layline of power (note them!). The zone must be on the ground floor or below. While you are on a layline, the following effects are activated:

- Magic overflows: Everyobody's [Spell Dices](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells) are recovered on a roll of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Life is abundant: Everybody's death rolls are made with advantage.
- Your tantrums create shockwaves! You can attempt to shove anybody in the area from any range.

## Feed the Laylines
If you plant a thing along a layline and come back to it after a long rest, you get rewarded:

- <ins>A Seed</ins>. The plant has fully grown.
- <ins>A Ration</ins>. 2 HD of local beasts or a swarm of local vermins were attracted to the location. You can give them a 3 word command which they will follow to the best of their ability and without taking reckless risks.
- <ins>Gems</ins>. Most of the area has collapsed.
- <ins>A Weapon</ins>. 3/4 chances to have rusted away. Those who dont become coated in [cold iron](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals).

## Not a Baby
You are now large, at least 10' tall and nearly as wide. You cant squeeze in tight spaces but your inventory size is doubled. You have advantage on combat maneuvres and can carry two handed weapons in one hand.
