Roll on the [1D200 Failed Medieval Careers](http://tenfootpolemic.blogspot.com/2014/01/200-failed-medieval-careers.html). If your roll gives you an animal, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)* for it.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Choose between your Failed Medieval Career, Sewers Life, or Aberrations.

For every Mutant template you have, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

**A:** Font of Flesh, Reactive Mutation<br>
**B:** Evolution<br>
**C:** Regeneration<br>
**D:** Gift of Flesh<br>

## Font of Flesh
Your mutations dont take Inventory slots. You can have as many mutations as your FORT score instead. If you would gain a mutation above your capacity, you explode, inflicting 1D4 damage per mutation to yourself and all nearby creatures. If you survive, you lose all your mutations and you roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Reactive Mutation
When you would be affected by something, you can roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*: You now resist that type of danger as defined by the Referee as long as you have this mutation. 

## Evolution
Once per game, when you gain a new mutation, you can choose to replace an existing one instead.

## Regeneration
You can spend your turn gruesomely regenerating. You heal 1D6 Wounds and HP. If you do, roll on the [1D500 mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html)*.

## Gift of Flesh
You can touch a willing creature and use your regeneration ability on it. Their mutations take an inventory slot.
