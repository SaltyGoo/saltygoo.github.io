<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of gold in food between two adventures (3 for a giant boar) to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training with the beast teaches you one short phrase in its language. Otherwise, it is proud and selfish.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Boar meat is delicious. Piglets can be domesticated to sniff things.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
