title: Engine of Pain
---

Mech-suits with construction tools. A construct with an unconscious humanoid inside.

A steaming, rusty mech-suit. Trapped inside are the vegetative remains of a punished humanoid. All it understands now are the orders of its master, and pain.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** strong, clumsy, but numb <br>
**Movement:** slow <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As a construct, the engine of pain can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue, fear, poison and diseases*.

Targeting the body inside the engine is made at disadvantage but inflicts 1D8 extra damage.

**Attacks (1/round)**
Each engine of pain is outfitted with a tool on each of its arms, roll 1D4 twice: 1, claw; 2, hammer; 3, drill; 4, sonic blaster.

<ins>Claw.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (1D6) and grapples on a hit.

<ins>Hammer.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (1D6) and a target with less than 5 STR is pushed nearby and falls prone. The damage is doubled against objects.

<ins>Drill.</ins> The engine makes one melee attack (2D4). Doubled against objects.

<ins>Sonic Blasters.</ins> Each adjacent creature and object immediately in front of the engine take (1D6). They take half damage and are not knocked on a successful save. The damage is doubled against objects.

<span class="alchemy">**Weapon of Pain**. Each of the engine of pain’s weapons can be used by anybody but arming them inflicts 1D6 intelligence damage. </span>

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
Engines of Pain are a new monster from DnD 5e found in [Mordenkainen's Tome of Foe](https://5e.tools/book.html#mtf). They are actually my favourite and I love them as is. However, I don't think they need to be purely a duergar thing. — SaltyGoo
