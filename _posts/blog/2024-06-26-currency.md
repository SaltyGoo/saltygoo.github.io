title: Simple Currency System
---


I like treasures as a driver for adventure, but I don't want to think about the precise value of things when I run a game. That’s why I have been functioning with “Bags of Gold Coins” as a currency instead of “Gold Coins” for a while now. That way I could speed up shopping segments by saying things like “Oh, you have a bag of gold coins? You can get 4 weapons or pieces of armour from this blacksmith.” Over the last two years, I realized my currency abstraction system needed to be able to express 3 things at my table: Big quantities of coins; pocket change; and five price tags to cover everything. This is how it evolved.

## The Coin Quantity System
This is the simplest, most barebone version of the system. Everything purchasable has the value of either a **purse** of coins, a **bag** of coins, or a **chest** full of coins. There are four bags in a chest and four purses in a bag. A **chest** is what one single player needs to level up.

One **purse** of gold coins allows you to buy one common adventuring expense such as a sword, a piece of armour, a week stay in an inn, a bundle of torches, etc. A **bag** of gold coins could get you a minor magical object, like a potion or a scroll, and takes 1 inventory slot. A **chest** is what one single player needs to level up.

This way, planning loot is easy: a dungeon should have the equivalent of as many chests full of coins as there are players. _You can stop reading here if you are happy with that._

## The Coin Quality System
The above system works just fine. However, it becomes awkward when dealing with very low values: Players love to loot bodies they “find” along the way, expecting a reward, but too many purses of gold make mindless murder too lucrative an endeavour, while giving nothing to loot instead is simply not fun.

For this reason, I tried to deepen the Purse-Bag-Chest system by adding back the classic D&D coin types: a purse full of **gemstones** is worth four purses of **gold** coins, which is worth four purses of **silver** coins, which in turn is worth four purses of **copper** coins.

With these added, the smallest value is a purse of **copper** coins. This would allow a basic meal or a single night in a shitty inn. A purse full of **silver** coins would then get you any mundane tool cheaper than a metal sword. 

This system could also be standalone, with 4 purses full of gems giving one level up. However, it becomes a little awkward when you need big _quantities_ of coins.

## There are only 5 price tags in D&D
Over the course of my games, I seem to have settled on 5 types of item worth: Basic, Mundane, Crafted, Mundane Magical, and Magical (which is the value of a level-up in an XP-as-Gold system). Any cost above that implies world-changing powers or scale that warrant something more than just a monetary transaction. Also, I’ve never seen a player that did not want to level up their character instead.

Big things like a tower or a boat should be considered a party expense. If you think acquiring them is well worth an adventure, make them cost a chest of gold per one or two player.
