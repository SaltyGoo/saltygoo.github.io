**R**: Touch  **D**: 1 hour

You call forth, from the foundries and factories of the Hellish war-machine, a deadly machine. The ultimate expression of overwhelming Avernian force manifests as, basically, a wheeled fortification, with enough interior space for [sum] passengers. It is too big to enter most corridors, has disadvantage on movement rolls, and cannot move if you dont pilot it. The Engine has [sum] HP and has [dice] of the following armaments:

- **Thick Armour:** The Engine has an [armor](/2020/11/09/base-rules/#combat) of 4.

- **Fire-Sprayer:** The Engine can, as an action, spray fire all over something (1D6) within 30'. Save for half. If the save is failed, the target is on fire and takes [dice] damage each round until it spends an action extinguishing the flames.

- **Whirling Blades:** The Engine can, as an action, make two melee attacks against different targets (1D8).

- **Legs:** Your standard wheeled Hellfire Engine fares poorly on uneven ground, but with the addition of gigantic insectoid legs, it can move as well as you!

- **Ballistae:** The Engine can, as an action, fire ballista bolts (1D12) 200' away. It takes a turn to recharge.

- **Voice Magnifier:** You can choose to have your voice projected forth from the Engine at deafening volumes.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
