title: Dungeon Generator 1 - Wintermill
---


Since my **[dungeon generator](/pages/randomdungeon2/)** _beta_ now has 50 monsters to pick from, I wanted to earnestly try to use it and build up from the generated results. For this dungeon, I settled on trying something that would fit in a highland plateau. With that in mind, I set the generator's biomes to _Plains_ and _Mountain_.

Here's the result that I got from the generator:

<summary>Creative Process</summary>
The **generated dungeon features** implie an old stone structure recently inhabited by humanoids. The plural levitating islands tell me I’ll need to group the rooms in separate island blocks and find ways to link them.

Looking at the **encounter table**, I notice it has two types of beasts, two types of humanoids, and one magical creature. It feels natural to group the bounty hunters and knights together as a faction. The air elementals would make a good rival faction, as they must be protecting the sky from something. While the hawks and griffons could be mounts or just roaming creatures. There’s a hint of a plot developing.

Looking at **the rooms**, I could imagine “entering” through the *cliffside path*, connecting to the highest peak and the rope bridge. It seems perfect as an introduction: the danger (falling) is clearly telegraphed and there are NPCs to drag the players in the dungeon’s conflict. The rope bridge could connect to the only other man-made room of the dungeon: the windmill, on a floating island, which could be the knights’ base. I’m left with the elemental portal and the thin spire. I want the elemental portal to be the base of the elementals, so I don't want it adjacent to the windmill. The spire could be on the same island however, with the windmill hanging from it. By placing the portal on a separate flying island and making it accessible by gliding from either the highest peak or the spire, I have created a nice loop and the architecture is complete! Let’s call this place Wintermill. The challenge of describing this dungeon is that most of it is outdoors, so nearly all visible at once, but it will make for a great exploration puzzle.

# Wintermill

Built by a wizard in the mountains a decade or so ago, Wintermill has caused much grief to the pastoral clans living in the highlands below: Since its appearance, summers have been cold and the pastures grown barren. To remedy the situation, the clans have pooled together their reserves of mountain poppies to hire two questing dream-knights of St-Nugibert. You do not have much time left if you want to claim the secrets of Wintermill and the bounty for yourself.

<ins>Possible Hooks</ins>
- Mountain poppy, which is mainly used in religious rituals by the locals, is a powerful narcotic and worth a lot of money in the Empire (enough to level up). It is used by dream-knights to astrally project for days.
- The dream-knights of St-Nugibert are based in the dream-fortress of the same name in the astral plane. If you would help them, they could give you access.
- The local shepherds' description of Wintermill would suggest the presence of a portal to the elemental plane of cold. Many powerful beings are imprisoned there.
- Bardinal, the wizard who built the mill, was a well known inventor. The mill must have an arcane purpose that you could harness.

### General Features

*Brisk and cold air. Climbable eroded stone surfaces. Two floating islands 200' above the ground and 90' away from the mountain's flank. During daytime, you can see giant hawks swooping through the cold wind of the **winter portal (#6)**.*

### Encounter Table
D6 every 30 minutes. The dungeon does not repopulate. You can also roll 1D6 every 20 minute to see in which room **Cunegund** and here crew are, and again to see where **Springsun** is.

### Dungeon Rooms

#### #1 WINTERMILL CLIMB
A narrow path snakes up a **90’ cliff** to a small 20’ plateau where **a small group of soldiers** are busy discussing.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
**You can see** the cliff going up further above to <ins>a snowy cloud-covered peak</ins> (#3) and <ins>a long rope bridge</ins> (#2) connecting the small plateau to <ins>a floating rock spire</ins> (#4) with a <ins>strange metal windmill</ins> (#5) on its side.

On the rope bridge, you observe a human struggle to carry a barrel across.

At your feet, the bones and bashed-in helmet of a soldier who obviously fell weeks ago from higher above.

From the plateau, you can also see <ins>another floating island</ins> (#6) spewing clouds. It is too far to jump to, but maybe could be possible from higher up like the peak or the spire. 

**You risk** <ins>falling</ins> if you go up the path because of the frequent pebbles falling down from above. <ins>Every 10 minutes</ins>, there is a 1 in 6 chance the barrel on the bridge falls.

**Taking time to search the space** will reveal that the intricate design of the <ins>bashed-in helmet</ins> is otherworldly, and that <ins>a shiny object</ins> is stuck between two rocks 90’ above the ground (a bronze ring worth a [purse of silver](/2024/06/26/currency/)).

**The soldiers** are <ins>Cunegund the astral knight</ins> and her 7 soldiers retinue. Their mission is to close the elemental portal on the cloudy island, but they first want to set up a base of operation in the safety of the mill (#5). They have 4 barrels of food and ale that they are in the middle of ferrying across the rope bridge (#2). They just planeshifted from their dream fortress and are willing to transport you there if you help them close the portal.

</details>

#### #2 WINDSWEPT ROPE BRIDGE
This 90’ rope bridge connects the top of **Wintermill Climb** (#1) to the **Floating Windmill Spire** (#4 & #5). The wind is strong here, and sparrows frequently zoom above and below in and out of their cliffside nests at impressive speed.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
**You can see** the vast highland plateau where you came from 200’ below and, in the middle of the bridge, <ins>Belfrey the squire</ins> is struggling to move a big barrel across to <ins>Rottrad the astral knight</ins>, who beckons him. <ins>Every 10 minutes</ins>, there is a 1 in 6 chance that Belfrey or his barrel falls. He is otherwise paralyzed by fear. 

**You risk** <ins>collapsing the bridge</ins> if you are not careful as it can only support the weight of two people (or one person and a barrel!). Any of the soldiers on the outcrop will tell you that as soon as you attempt to go on it. That is why nobody is helping Belfrey. The barrel contains ale.

**Taking time to search the space** the space will reveal that one of the pegs anchoring the bridge to the cliff is in fact a <ins>weathered scepter</ins> marked as belonging to the wizard Bardinal (like a mace but worth a [bag of gold](/2024/06/26/currency/)). Removing it will make the bridge collapse and the spire drift away.

**Belfrey and Rottrad** are trying to set up a base in the shelter of the windmill. They are companions of <ins>Cunegund the astral</ins> knight but want to abandon this annoying mission. Rottrad has the key to the mill.

</details>

#### #3 SNOW-COVERED PEAK
You must **climb a 60’ cliff** from Wintermill Climb (#1) in the clouds to reach this peak. It’s a 30’ x 30’ snowy plateau with a big gnarly pine growing on the edge.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
**You can see** <ins>a giant bird nest</ins> in the tree as well as a <ins>small stone landmark</ins> in the middle. If you look down <ins>Wintermill Climb</ins> (#1) is hidden under the clouds, but the <ins>Floating Spire</ins> (#4) is clearly visible 90’ away. Below, 60’ away from both the spire and you, you observe a vortex of clouds. This is the <ins>Winter Portal</ins> (#6), another floating island.

**Taking time to search the space** the space will reveal a <ins>bounty notice</ins> nailed on the landmark. This notice offers a treasure's worth of mountain poppy to whoever closes the portal and brings the notice back to the highland clans. The notice will be stolen if Springsun the bounty hunter ever comes across it. A more recent engraving reads “RIP Synard”. A <ins>porcelain breastplate</ins> similar to those worn by Cunegund and Rottrad is laid beside it.

The **Giant Bird Nest** is home to the two <ins>Giant Hawks</ins> that roam the dungeon. They only nest at night. You ride them or pluck them to fashion gliders to reach the Winter Portal if you want.

</details>

#### #4 FLOATING SPIRE
This spire is only 30’ wide, but 90’ tall. It is connected to **Wintermill Climb** (#1) by a Rope Bridge (#2). A **Metal Windmill** (#5) is built near the lower third of the spire, and is linked to the rope bridge by a small metal ladder. There is a hardy pine growing sideways from the top third of the spire.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
**You can see** another floating rock 60’ away spewing clouds upwards in a whirl pattern. This is the <ins>Winter Portal</ins> (#6). The clouds cling to the <ins>Snow-Covered Peak</ins> (#3). You would have a better view if you climbed to the top of the spire. However, you must save against vertigo to do so, as the land is more than 200’ below you.

**If you climb** to the top of the spire, you have a gorgeous view of the land and you’ll notice the <ins>tattered banner of the knights you’ve met erratically billowing. It seems that if you had a way to glide, you could reach the <ins>Winter Portal</ins> (#6) from here.

**Taking time to search the space** the space will reveal <ins>1 griffon egg</ins> in the tree branches and a <ins>porcelain shield</ins> with the knights’ heraldry. You notice that <ins>the winds</ins> are very unnatural, oscillating from the windmill to the portal back and forth.

</details>

#### #5 WINTERMILL
The mill is a 20’ by 30’ vertical metal cylinder. A locked wooden door leads inside and is accessible through a short metal ladder. There is a broken window on the opposite side from the door, but climbing the slick metal structure is impossible. You would need to climb **The Spire** (#4) and rappel down from the roof. The knights have trapped the window with a **bear trap** to catch nesting griffons.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
Inside, **you can see** most of the space is occupied by a <ins>huge spinning copper turbine</ins> and 3 wall mounted <ins>vibrating crystals</ins>. The floor is littered with shattered cattle bones left over by <ins>a griffon</ins> that has been coming through the window to nest in the mill. 

Taking time to **search the space** will reveal a long <ins>80’ rope</ins> coiled by the door. It will also reveal that the <ins>turbine</ins> is actually spinning by itself and that the spinning wheel of the windmill outside is actually some sort of propeller. Finally, examining the <ins>crystals</ins> reveals the whispers of a trapped <ins>air elemental</ins> powering the machine. A clever person could craft kites out of the windmills's wings.

The trapped **air elemental** was bound here by Bardinal, the wizard who built the mill, and it wants to be free. It can be freed by shattering the crystals with blunt weapons or loud noises. Freeing the elemental will lead the spire to crash 200’ below after 1 turn, giving just enough time for the characters to attempt to jump on and cling to <ins>Rope Bridge</ins> (#2). The elemental could be convinced to steer the mill to dock to the <ins>Winter Portal</ins> (#6) in exchange for its freedom.

**The mill**’s intended purpose was to serve as the base of Bardinal the Wizard’s <ins>roaming tower</ins>. He was however defenestrated by the elemental in a last act of defiance before it was bound to the turbine and the rest of the tower could be built on <ins>The Spire</ins> (#4). If the mill is untethered from the cliff by the rope bridge and the elemental is still bound, the spire would start flying away. Sails would need to be installed on the spire to be able to steer it.

</details>

#### #6 THE WINTER PORTAL
A 30’ wide flying earth mote with white **runestones** in a circle. The runestone circle spews cold clouds upwards in a whirl pattern. It is always snowing here. You can use the portal to enter the **Plane of Cold**. If you do, after 6 hours, the knights will achieve to close the portal and you will have to find another way back.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Details</summary>
  
**You can see** the <ins>tattered banner</ins> of the knights planted deep into the edge of the mote. It was left there by <ins>Marion the knight</ins> after she glided from the top of the <ins>The Spire</ins> (#4) to the portal, and before she was knocked over the edge by a strong gust of wind.

**By taking time to search the space**, you’ll start hearing a <ins>whisper</ins> in the wind telling you to jump. It is the voice of an <ins>air elemental</ins> garding the portal. If you do jump, it will laugh, catch you and bring you back up. You’ll also understand that the <ins>heavy runestones</ins> can be lifted and thrown out to close the portal. If you do so, the air elemental will become hostile. There are 10 runestones. Removing one diminishes the portal and lowers the island by 20’ until it reaches the ground 200’ feet below and closes.

The **guardian elemental**’s mission is to keep the portal open until its friend can go back home. It frequently patrols the valley in search of it, unaware that it is trapped in the <ins>windmill</ins> (#5) nearby. When it does so, it drags the <ins>winter wind</ins> down through the highlands, unwittingly bringing hardship to the pastoral clans that live there. If the trapped elemental is freed, they both escape back to the Plane of Cold and the winter portal crashes down.

### Magical Items

#### Bardinal's Scepter
Damage as a mace. Countains an bound [Earth Elemental](/monsters/elemental-earth). Ignores the resistances of elemental creatures. If a creature is struck by the scepter, it must save or bound to the ground for 1 turn.

#### Porcelain Breastplate and Shield
Designed for the astral knights of St-Nugibert. The objects themselves are fireproof and share the same cosmic vibration. If both are worn, the shield can be used as a kitesail in the material plane, and as a hoverboard in the astral plane.

_I'm pretty happy with the results :) and exactly how I envisioned using the generator. When the biomes are a bit more fleshed out with more monsters, I'm excited to try that again. Probably as one of the two possible follow ups to this one-day dungeon : the plane of cold and the astral knights fortress._

Thanks for reading! Ping me on discord if you run it!
