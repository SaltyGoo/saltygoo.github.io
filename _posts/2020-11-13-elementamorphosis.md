D: [dice]*10 minutes

Depending on the number of dices you invest in this spell, you convert a fist or smaller body part (1), a limb (2), half your body (3), or your entire body and all your equipment (4) into [element]. You also step up the unarmed damage die for attacks with that part of your body, and it deals a relevant type of damage.
