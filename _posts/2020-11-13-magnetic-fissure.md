**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

What came from earth shall return to it. You create an invisible line of magnetic force within two points within range. The line can pass through solid objects. Anything crossing the line while wearing metal armour takes [sum] damage and must save or fall prone. Creatures made of iron, or with metal implants or piercings or delicate components, take [sum]+[dice] damage instead and fall prone.
