**D**:  [dice] days

Your voice shifts the perspective of [sum] creatures who hear it. They don’t necessarily believe what you’re saying per se, but unless they save against magic, they accept the fundamental premises and values that underly your words, even if those would ordinarily conflict with their own. Whenever their new ideals drive them into a course of action that would violate their existing ideals, they get another save to end it.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
