<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some large or bigger [beasts](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-beast) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Underlined abilities are added to the attack options of the original creature. If necessary, you can adjust the damage dice to match the base monsterâ€™s.* </span>

Humanoids have found many ways to use hulking beasts for war. War beasts have powers that support smaller, weaker creatures in combat situations like sieges.<br>
