title: Golem, Stone
---

Animated stone statue. A construct.

A statue made of solid stone. When it moves, it's in simplistic, straightforward gestures.

**HD:** 5  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong, clumsy, and sturgy, but robotic <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As a construct, the Stone Golem can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue, fear, poison and diseases*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, the Stone Golem is *resistant to fire and magic*.

The golem’s activation glyph is hidden on some stone carving. If destroyed, the golem is deactivated. It can be altered to change its order. Roll a D12 for its location:

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
This is a streamlining of Arnold K's amazing take on the [golem](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/golems.html). Traditionally, stone golems have a slow ability, which never made sense to me, so I added a shockwave that allows it to prevent unsuspecting adventurers from running away. — SaltyGoo
