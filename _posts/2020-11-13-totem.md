R: 60’ 		D: [dice]*10 minutes

Every person has two totems, a predator totem and a prey totem, which are connected and should be determined randomly (and recorded for future reference):

1. bat/centipede
1. cat/rat
1. hawk/newt
1. owl/frog
1. serpent/chicken
1. wolf/sheep

This spell allows you to transform into your predator totem animal or force another into prey totem, though a saving throw applies in that case. People in totem form are marked by the your sigil in an obvious location and equipment does not transform.
