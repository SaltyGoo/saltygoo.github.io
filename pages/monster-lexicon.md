The monster stat blocks are written to be easily adaptable into many OSR-sphere systems. I wrote in *italic* the philosophy behind each stat so that GMs reverse engineer them into other systems.

Note: the monster stat blocks are currently being updated! this will progressively become obsolete.

**HD:** Hit Dice. Roll as many D6s for the monster's HP. <br>
*note - The highest HD is 10 and the lowest is 0. Roll D8s for old school DnD. Multiply by 3 for 5e.*

**Armor:** damage resistance: leather (1), chain (2), plate (3). <br>
*note - I don't use armor class, but you can easily replace these with whatever these armors do in your system.*

**Size:** tiny (cat and smaller), small (kid), medium (adult), large (horse, ogre), huge (elephant, windmill), gargantuan (whale and bigger)

**Stats:** Described in relation to an average human.

**Movement:** Described in relation to human running speed.

**Morale:** coward (flees at first wound), brave (flees at 50% HP), reckless (stays if not alone), mindless (never flees).

Abilities that relate more to how the monster lives like darkvision, keen smell and water breathing are listed in one paragraph.

**Non-combat magic:** Described in broad terms and is intended for flourish, ambience and villainy. For example, you would expect a Dryad knowing druidcraft to have created a magical grove, a cultist knowing conjuring to have summoned some minions, or an Efreet knowing pyromancy to create eternal torches without clogging their spell lists with spells doing just that.

**Attacks:** Each round, a monster can perform a certain number of actions listed. Of course the context might call for new ones at the referee's discretion.

<ins>Actual Attack.</ins> A melee attack hits an adjacent target, a melee attack with reach can hit targets behind adjacent ones, a short range means within 1 turn of movement, a ranged attack means far. <ins>Recharge 2/6.</ins> means that the creature has a 2/6 chance each round to be able to use the ability.

<ins>Spellcasting (X).</ins> The number in brackets is the number of spells that can be cast by combat.

## Random Encounter
Roll if the monster is in the encounter list of a hexcrawl or a dungeon.

1. **Monster:** The number of creatures
2. **Lair:** In a hexcrawl, where the monster (and its treasures) live. There is a 50% chance the monster is currently away. <br>    &nbsp; OR <br>    **Omen:** In a dungeon, the monster is here but the players have a few moments to prepare.
3. **Spoor:** Recent trace of the monster. It's in the area nearby, if the players want, they can easily find it.
4. **Tracks:** If the players decide to follow them, roll a D3 on this list to see where they lead.
5. **Trace:** A sign of the monster's presence in the ecosystem. A good tracker could use these to find tracks.

## Other Type Specific Tables

Each monster type has defining features and unique tables described in the [monster type](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters) section.
