<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for information on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature A - Lower Plateau</span>

Adventurous explorers willing to climb the Cloud Peaks in this area will probably rethink their endeavour here, on the last flat area not covered by snow. At night, the dark crags that surround the plateau echo with the discordant screams of the gibberling horde.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Higher Plateau</span>

The air is cold and thin on this snowy plateau. The climate and altitude provide a shelter from the political intrigues of Amn and Baldur's Gate, but only the hardiest of alpinists will survive the trek.

---

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Hidden Monastery of the Dark Moon</span>

The sharran monks of the Dark Moon have assassinated the previous inhabitants of the monastery and consecrated it to the goddess of the night. Enter at your own peril, but they have probably detected you.
