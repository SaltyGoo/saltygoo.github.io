title: Fighting Styles

This is my interpretation of all 5e fighting styles inspired by [deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com)'s GLOG [conversions](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2022/12/call-me-what-you-will-glog-classes-5e.html) of the 5e fighter subclasses. 5e Fighting styles stuck out to me because they represent everything I'm trying not to do in Salty Goo, but they also could give so much ~style~ to a character. Like, their names evoke a lot, but their effects are things like "+2 to hit"... 

I started my conversion without knowing what was the intended usage of these abilities, but I knew I wanted to avoid any +X bonuses and be more narrative.

You are as tense as your bowstring. When you have your ranged weapon ready, you can interrupt the referee at any moment to shoot whatever they are describing. You have the advantage if you do not know what the target is yet. If you hit an actual danger to you or your friends, you are calmed for the rest of your day.
