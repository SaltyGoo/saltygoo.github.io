<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some [humanoids](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-humanoid) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Bold abilities are passive, underlined ones are added to the attack options of the original creature. If necessary, you can adjust the damage dice to match the base monster’s. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Sorcerers are innate spellcasters who can unleash powerful spells upon which they have little control. They are often magical creatures themselves that honed their powers beyond normal, or mortals bound to a specific element.
