## Damage Types

If you want to do more with the elements, you can remove a damage dice from your attack to have a powerful on-hit effect instead:
- <ins>Acid:</ins> negate armor for a round.
- <ins>Cold:</ins> prevent movement for a round.
- <ins>Electric:</ins> attack another nearby target for 1 dice.
- <ins>Fire:</ins> destroy a flammable small object.
- <ins>Mind:</ins> charm for a round.
- <ins>Magical:</ins> ignore resistance.
- <ins>Poison:</ins> poison for a round.

<summary>Example</summary>
*Margh the Vile casts a spell inflicting 2D6 electric damage to a goblin. She can choose to inflict 1D6 damage instead and attack another nearby goblin for 1D6 damage. Boo Son of Jean has a sword of frost inflicting 1D8 damage, but he wants to capture the enemy alive. Instead, he sacrifices the D8. On a hit, he inflicts 0 damage and the monster's feet are frozen to the ground for a round.*

<ins>Fatigued:</ins> -1 to all stats. Cumulative.

<ins>Frightened:</ins> You cannot interact with the source of your fear until you have spent a full turn without seeing it. Roll a D6: 1) drop whatever you are holding; 2) scream; 3) fall prone; 4) grapple the closest ally or object; 5) you are stunned for one turn; 6) run away.

## Rare Metals

Fairies, elementals, ghosts and devils resist or ignore damage. But some rare metals overcome that. Additionally, Adamantium and Platinum weapons are very useful for fighters because they don't get destroyed when they use their [parry](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/fighter#parry) ability.

<ins>Adamantium:</ins> Nothing is more solid than adamantium. You can forgo a damage dice when inflicting damage with it to destroy an object. An adamantium object is unbreakable.

<ins>Cold Iron:</ins> A faerie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

<ins>Silver:</ins> Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and of creatures that are not in their true form.

<ins>Mithral:</ins> Is light like cloth. Weapons made of mithral can be used with Dexterity. Armors made of mithral do not penalize Dexterity.

<ins>Radium:</ins> Radium sheds light like a candle and inflicts 1D4 extra poison damage. It ignores the resistances of celestial creatures like angels and devils. After each adventure spent carrying radium, save or gain a [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html).

<ins>Platinum:</ins> Platinum repairs itself in 1 hour. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrations as well as their horrid immortality.

## Traveling

Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action takes 10 minutes. The referee rolls for random encounters every 30 minutes and asks the players to choose odd or even, if they lose, one torch or lantern is depleted.

On the world map, any worthwhile action like crossing a hex or exploring an hex takes a 4h block (*Dawn, Midday, Afternoon, Dusk, Evening, Night*). Roll for encounters for each location change. Environmental penalties can happen.
