title: Garradalaigh, Audreena
---

Weird chimera that trades magical good deeds for the gift of mammal friendship.. A fey.

Imagine for a moment a winged unicorn, except this one seems way off upon closer inspection: six legs, four goat eyes, a horn more akin to a rhinoceros’s, fleshy wings, and a neck that is actually a caterpillar’s body.

**HD:** 5  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** horse strength, keen spirit and health<br>
**Movement:** fast, fly average, swim fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

As a fairy, the audreena *resists mundane weapons and spells* and WIS must be used for attack rolls against it. However, if it touches cold iron, it loses all its abilities and spells for a round.

Additionally, audreenas are know all wizards and have keen eyesight. They can speak telepathically to any warm-blooded creature in sight and breathe underwater.

More extraordinary: audreenas only exist to adjacent creatures and cannot be affected whatsoever by creatures further away.

**Non-combat Magic**
Divination, Illusion

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Ram.</ins> The audreena runs its full movement and makes a melee attack (2D4). On a hit, targets with less than 7 STR fall prone.

<ins>Kicks.</ins> The audreena makes two melee attacks (1D6).

<ins>Spellcasting (4)</ins>. *Confusion, Improved Invisibility, Clairvoyance*.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

So this thing was real in the end and you killed it. Its flesh is a potent hallucinogenic that lasts days.

<span class="alchemy">**Garradalaigh Flesh**. You can see figments of your imagination as real for 1D4 days, but you can only describe them as subject and verb, with the referee finishing the description.</span>

Accepting and audreena’s boon will inspire a wizard to write a spell with the word *Speach* in it.

<span class="alchemy">**Audreena Boon**.  Allows you to speak with all warm blooded creatures.</span>

<summary>Credits</summary>
Garradalaighs are weird creations of the TSR Birthright setting made for AD&D 2e. I really love to discover new monsters like this one which really seems rooted in mythology but isn't. My adaptation is true to the original, if a bit simplified in its stats. It's as if these monsters were already contemporary in their originality.</details>
