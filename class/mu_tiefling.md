<ins>Perk</ins><br>
Any time you would roll for a new spell when you level up, you can roll 1D6 on the infernal perks list instead:

1. Choose two [damage types](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#damage-types), you resist one of them and take double damage from the other.
1. Your eyes glow like candlelight. You can see as if you were holding a torch. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, choose a color: you can see it in the dark.
1. You can make a second attack with your horns (1D4 damage). For each subsequent time you roll this perk, your horns get 1' taller or wider (you choose) and their damage increases by 1 dice size.
1. When you wield a melee weapon, it inflicts 1D4 extra fire damage. On an attack roll of 1, a nonmagical weapon burns or melts. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, increase the dice size by 1.
1. When you have no wounds, you have a flight speed of 0. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, increase it by 1.
1. You have minions in one settlement of your choice. Each time you spend time carousing there, you can recruit one fanatical hireling for free. If nearby, they can sacrifice themselves to protect you from 1D8 points of damage. For each subsequent time you roll this perk, you can either add a settlement to your cult, increase the number of free hirelings in one settlement, or increase the damage prevented by a minion's sacrifice by one dice size.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
You have horns, vestigal wings and a tail: you cannot wear armors and helmets that are not custom made. Reactions toward you by God-fearing creatures can only be hatred. Roll charisma to have somebody fear you instead.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- You can speak backward, a language only understood by exorcists and divine creatures.
- Hearts are like cocain to you. When you eat a fresh heart, for the next hour, you gain advantage on any roll as long as it is for a selfish action made in an asshole-ish way. For the following hour, you have disadvantage on all rolls that are not for a selfish action made in an asshole-ish way.
- You cannot be burned by flames smaller than a bonfire.
