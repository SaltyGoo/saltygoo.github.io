R: Touch  D: 1 hour

You call forth, from the foundries and factories of the Hellish war-machine, a deadly machine. The ultimate expression of overwhelming Avernian force, it manifests as, basically, a wheeled fortification, with enough interior space for [sum] passengers. It is too big to enter most corridors, is slow, has [sum] HP, use your charisma for attacks and has [dice] of the following armaments: 

- **Thick Armour:** The Engine has an armor of 4.

- **Fire-Sprayer:** The Engine can, as an action, spray fire all over something (1D6) within 30'. Save for half. If the save is failed, the target is on fire and takes [dice] damage each turn until it spends an action extinguishing the flames.

- **Whirling Blades:** The Engine can, as an action, make two melee attacks against different targets (1D8).

- **Legs:** Your standard wheeled Hellfire Engine fares poorly on uneven ground, but with the addition of gigantic insectoid legs, it can move as well as you! 

- **Ballistae:** The Engine can, as an action, fire ballista bolts (1D12) 200' away. It takes a turn to recharge. 

- **Voice Magnifier:** You can choose to have your voice projected forth from the Engine at deafening volumes.
