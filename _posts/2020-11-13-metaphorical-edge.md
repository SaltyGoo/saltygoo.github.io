title: Metaphorical Edge
---
D: [dice] * 10 minutes

Slide two fingers along the edge of something. It becomes as sharp as a razor (1D6 + [dice]). If the edge is metaphorical, the sharpness is also metaphorical. In this case, you must physically touch the metaphorical edge, as you would a literal one.
 
###### metaphorical + edge
