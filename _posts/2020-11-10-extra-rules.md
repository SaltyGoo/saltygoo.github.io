Rules that are referee-facing or that complexify the game

## Conditions

<ins>Blinded:</ins> You can't see or make ranged attacks. Attacking and Dodging are hard rolls.

<ins>Cursed:</ins> You cannot benefit from any magic.

<ins>Dazed:</ins> You can act OR move on your turn.  

<ins>Deafened:</ins> You can't hear. Your teammates cannot talk to you or about you.

<ins>Fatigued:</ins> -1 to your Inventory and Psyche slots. Cumulative.

<ins>Poisoned:</ins> You are disadvantaged in all your actions. Specific poisons can have unique additional effects too.

## Damage Types

If you want to do more with the elements, you can remove a damage dice from your attack to have a powerful on-hit effect instead:
- <ins>Acid:</ins> negate armor for a round.
- <ins>Cold:</ins> prevent movement for a round.
- <ins>Electric:</ins> attack another nearby target for 1 dice.
- <ins>Fire:</ins> destroy a flammable small object.
- <ins>Mind:</ins> charm for a round.
- <ins>Magical:</ins> ignore resistance.
- <ins>Poison:</ins> poison for a round.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example</summary>
*Morgana the Vile casts a spell inflicting 2D6 electric damage to a goblin. She can choose to inflict 1D6 damage instead and attack another nearby goblin for 1D6 damage. Boo Son of Jean has a sword of frost inflicting 1D8 damage, but he wants to capture the enemy alive. Instead, he sacrifices the D8. On a hit, he inflicts 0 damage and the monster's feet are frozen to the ground for a round.*

## Rare Metals

Fairies, elementals, ghosts and devils resist or ignore damage. But some rare metals overcome that. Additionally, Adamantium and Platinum weapons are very useful for fighters because they don't get destroyed when they use their [parry](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/fighter#parry) ability.

<ins>Adamantium:</ins> Nothing is more solid than adamantium. You can forgo a damage dice when inflicting damage with it to destroy an object. An adamantium object is unbreakable.

<ins>Cold Iron:</ins> A fairie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

<ins>Silver:</ins> Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and of creatures that are not in their true form.

<ins>Mithral:</ins> Is light like cloth. Attacks made with mithral weapons are one step easier than normal but the damage die is one size smaller. Mithral armor doesn't impede movement.

<ins>Radium:</ins> Radium sheds light like a candle. It ignores the resistances of celestial creatures like angels and devils. After each adventure spent carrying radium, save or gain a [mutation](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html).

<ins>Platinum:</ins> Platinum repairs itself in 1 hour. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrations as well as their horrid immortality.
