**R**: Touch

Touched restrained beast immediately turns into a beastman. Roll a D6: on a roll of 1, it is as intelligent as it was before; on a roll of 6, it is more intelligent than you; on a roll of 2 to 5, it's slightly less intelligent than you.

You permanently lose 1 Psyche slot. You choose [dice] memories, knowledge, goals, and personality you want to copy into the beastman. Otherwise it matches the tropes of the original animal. The beastman is not more loyal to you than it was when it was just a beast.
