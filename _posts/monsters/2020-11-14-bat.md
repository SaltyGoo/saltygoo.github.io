_Imagine flying mouse-like creatures with leathery arm-wings._

Bats are nocturnal insectivores that nest in dark spaces. A tiny beast.

| **Hit it:** normal | **Dodge it:** special |
| **Movement:** fly fast      | 

##### <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Armor = damage reduction · · · Easy/Normal/Hard = roll above 10/15/20 to beat">→ How to read monster stats</span>

It can hear very well, allowing it to easily spot their preys in the dark, even invisible ones.

In a swarm, creatures are **immune** to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and **resist** mind and weapon damage. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bites.</ins> To dodge a swarm’s attack, the roll has to beat 10 + the swarm's HP. It inflicts 1 damage. If you have been bitten by a bat, roll a D10 before you rest. On a roll of one you have caught bat flu.

## So, You Are Hunting Bats?

New carousing activities!

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame the Beast</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Craft from Beast Parts</summary>
There is not much one can retrieve from a bat. Even though their meat is edible, there is a 10% chance that a bat carries the highly contagious bat flu.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. If you use mundane tools, the result will be mundane; if you spent at least a bag of gold on it, the object will be special; and if you spend the equivalent of a treasure for the tools, it will be magical. Discuss what you want with the referee.
