**R**: 90â€™

A creature that has wronged you suffers some minor petty inconvenience that, among other things, inflicts them 1D4 points of damage.

For each way in which the inconvenience is ironic, you can upgrade the scale of the inconvenience and the damage die size, up to a maximum of [dice] times. 

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and the convenience is ironic in at least 4 ways, you can decide to have it be deadly: if the target fails a save, it dies.
