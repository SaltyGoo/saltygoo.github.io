#### Mycomorphosis.

D: Sigil

You engrave your Sigil on a parasitic fungus, which you swallow. If you die and are eaten, one random creature which has consumed you will be infected by your parasite and die within 1D6 days unless cured, at which point you will take over its body.

You retain your powers and mental statistics but take the physical ones of the new body, which will progressively decay over [sum] days, at which point the process will repeat again.

There is always 1 out of 6 chance that you reincarnate into a fly.
