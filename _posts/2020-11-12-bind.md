**R**: 60â€™		**D**: [dice]*10 minutes

You summon invisible, extra-dimensional chains. The chains grapple [dice] creatures who fail a save and are impossible to break free from, even through teleportation. 

Bindings may be set as traps by laying your Sigil on a surface, you decide the trigger.

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, and target only one creature, the effect becomes permanent.
