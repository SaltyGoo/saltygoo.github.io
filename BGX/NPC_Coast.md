<br><span class="NPC"> **Pallonia, Contemplating Nun**<br><br>She's sitting on a rock, contemplating the waves. Thin, long teeth, blue eyes. Her nun habits are weathered and too big for her. She sees the future.<br><br>*"I know why you're here. It's the same reason everyone else comes to see me, and you shall get the same answer..."*</span>

- **The Problem** -- There are much bigger, cosmic forces at play than local conflicts between bandits and merchants, and nobody is acting on them. The children of a god is roaming the area, bringing chaos in its wake and nervousness in Heaven!

- **Wants** -- Acknowledgement of the cosmic disturbance, or alternatively be left alone.

- **Hates** -- Mundane questions, petty questions, selfish questions.

- **Quirk** -- Thinks on a broader scale than you. Never stops contemplating the waves.

- **Stats** -- As a *Diviner*.

<br><span class="NPC"> **Shoal, Blackmailed Nereid**<br><br>She jumps out of a wave, brine made naked flesh, with hair like waterfall and tears like foam.<br><br>*"Please to help me, will you? I am alone on this desolate dry-land and who knows what lurks in these woods."*</span>
