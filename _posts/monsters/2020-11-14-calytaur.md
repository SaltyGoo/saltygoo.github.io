Pigfolk or boarfolk. An humanoid.

Imagine a humanoid covered in mud and with the face of a pig. It stinks of feces and dirt.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as worn <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy and dumb. <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Calytaurs can smell in the dark as if they were seeing. Additionally, if an attack would reduce the calytaur to 0 HP, it can roll 1D6 and reduce the damage by as much out of sheer stubbornness.

**Attacks (3/round)**

<ins>Great-Axe.</ins> The calytaur makes one melee attack (1D8).

<ins>Charge.</ins> If it has the space for it, the calytaur charges with its axe (1D8 + 1). A target with STR below 8 falls prone.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The original creation of [Richard J Leblanc](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-monster-calytaur.html) refers to the calydonian boar of greek myths. I personaly used them more as bacchanalian hillbilly cultists pig people in my games, so it might have tainted my encounter table. I gave them a relentless ability similar to boars to avoid making them orc clones. â€” SaltyGoo
