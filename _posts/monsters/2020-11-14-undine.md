*Water elementals that long for the chaos of a mortal life. Elemental and Fairy.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Adapting the undine was difficult: like most elementals, the [DnD version](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elemchfw.html) of the creature is pretty unimaginative in both shape and ability (its a stronger water weird with spells). In this case however, the real life counterpart of the myth is fascinating: not only it is at the origin of the concept of an elemental creature, but also the inspiration behind the story of the Little Mermaid (elemental creatures are immortal but have no soul, if they marry a human, they become mortals but gain an eternal soul). I decided to take the powers of the DnD creature and flavor it as the original myth. Also, because the undine is an elemental that dreams, I made it fairy as well. — SaltyGoo* </span>

The Undine has two forms: a beautiful humanoid, its skin the color of a stormy wave or frothy waters and hair that is liquid, or an amorphous blob of water with multiple apendages. It speaks like a glass harp.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 8 / 6 / 5 / 4 / 7 <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** average, swim fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The undine is made of pure water: it can squeeze through any hole and is invisible while submerged. It can be frozen or boiled, in which case it loses all resistances.

**Water:** On its turn, if the undine is not in contact with water, it takes 1D4 points of damage.

**Shape Change:** The undine can change shape between a blob of water and a humanoid at will. It only has a walking speed if its in humanoid form, and a swim speed in blob form. Its attacks are also different.

**Blob Attacks:** Each round, the undine in blob shape can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Slam</ins>. The undine makes a melee attack (x) with a water tentacle which can reach anywhere nearby.

<ins>Grapple</ins>. The undine makes a grapple attack against any nearby target. A grappled target cannot breathe.

<ins>Choke</ins>. The undine inflicts constitution damage (x) to a grappled target. 

**Humanoid Attacks:** Each round, the undine in blob shape can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Cast Spell</ins>. *Detect Magic, Dispel Magic, Dust to Water, Geas*

<ins>Freezing Touch</ins>. The undine makes a melee attack (x).

## Conjuring an Undine

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 4 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Undine** <br>
R: self 

The spell provides enough water for the undine to walk on earth for [dice] hours without suffering. It is enthused by the prospect of spending time with mortals, but will refuse to partake in physical violence. If you point it to a particular humanoid, it will attempt to charm it and ultimately cast geas on it
