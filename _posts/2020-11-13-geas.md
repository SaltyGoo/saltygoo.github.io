D: [dice] week

You curse a victim with a geas, a terrible malison enforcing an inescapable command. The command can be to do a long or difficult task, but it must be possible. The victim can save to resist, but if they fail your Sigil will instantly appear on them. From then each day that is not spent fulfilling the geas will give to the victim one of the following megrims:

- Loss of power (an ability).
- Loss of health (âˆ’1D6 to random stat).
- Loss of health (disease).
- Loss of energy (fatigue).
- Loss of mean (money or property).
- One of their close relatives or friends suffer a random megrim.

For any day that the victim works toward fulfilling the geas, one of these accrued megrims will resolve as if it never were there.

A side effect of the geas is that the victim is empowered by the geas: depending on the Referee they gain some power, like seeing in the dark, breathe water, or something more akin to a spell effect. 

Should the task become impossible, a [catastrophe](/class/magic-user#spells) happens to the caster and victim. If either die, it does not stop the spell, as their soul will still be bound by it.

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent.
