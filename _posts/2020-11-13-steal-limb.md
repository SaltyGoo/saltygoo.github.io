**R**:  Touch    **D**:  [sum] x 10 minutes

You swap body parts with a creature, provided you both have the chosen parts (eyes, nose, lips, hands, patches of skin, hair, etc.). Unwilling creatures may save to resist this effect.

If you invest 4 or more [dice] in this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effects become permanent.
