*Giant cats with a deadly bite. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *An underused classic of pulp. I added a truely deadly effect to its bite to differenciate it from a lion. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a stocky, muscular lionness with two enormous scimitar-like canine sprouting out of its top jaw.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / 7 / 7 / 1 / 6 / 4  <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

Cats are stealthy and have a very keen sense of sight and smell allowing them to operate in the dark. 

**Attacks:** Each round, the sabertooth cat can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Claws.</ins> The sabertooth cat makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Pounce.</ins> The sabertooth cat makes a running jump and lands on a target, which is allowed a save to avoid damage. On a hit, the target takes damage (2x), is prone and grappled.

<ins>Tear Throat.</ins> The sabertooth makes a melee attack against a prone target. On a hit, it gains a Wound.
