<summary>Credits</summary>
Aqraseths are a creation of  [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I matched its abilities with those of a DnD crocodile and made a giant version, because it looks like a semi-plausible dinosaur species already. â€” SaltyGoo
