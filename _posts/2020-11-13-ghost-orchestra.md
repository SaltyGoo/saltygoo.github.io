D: [dice]*10 minutes

You are surrounded by the harmonious sounds of an invisible ghostly five-piece band for the duration of the spell. All of your actions now have more panache and flair. If you hide, the music stops, only to burst into a dramatic loud chord jump scare, stunning surprised creatures. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
