title: Seal of Retribution
---

Places your Sigil on a location or threshold to protect it and strike with retribution anyone foolish enough to violate it. 

The seal stops any being from passing, forming a visible, opalescent barrier. When destroyed, for example by dealing it [sum] damage, it deals [dice]D6 damage to anyone in the area, save to halve.

You can subtly customize the seal in the following ways: 

- Specify a covenant and limit the effect either only to the group or to anyone but those part of it.
- Specify the kind of magical energy unleashed: it can be fire, cold, lightning or more: for example mere sunlight, harmful only to undead.
- Specify a trigger for the retributive strike.

This seal is very visible.
