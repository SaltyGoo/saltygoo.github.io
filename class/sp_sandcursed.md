## Curse of Sand
When you would get [Wounds](/2020/11/09/base-rules/#dying--healing), you instead fill as many inventory slots with cursed sand. This sand cannot be removed from your inventory normally. You might never die, but you will eventually be unable to move.

## Ululate
Your ululations carry far. They can be faintly heard across any outdoors location in your hex if you are outside, or anywhere in the dungeon you are in. To most, they are just screams, but you can hold complex conversations with other sand-cursed people in such a way. In any case, using this ability triggers an encounter, but, if you are outside, it will also summon a mount for you to ride.

## Cure of Sand
You can cure yourself of poisons, diseases, curses, or a day of hunger by filling one inventory slot with cursed sand.

## Dune Ambush
You can dive in sand as if it was water and breathe in it as if it was air.

## Dust Devil
Once per day, you can create a cloud of dust big enough to obscure as many creatures as you have slots of cursed sand. This cloud lasts 10 minutes, is centered around you and moves with you. It does not impede your vision or your ululations.

## Half-Statue
Each slot of cursed sand counts as a piece of Armor. You cannot have more than 10 Armor.
