<summary>Design Notes</summary>
I nearly only play with rpg beginners, and even though the GLOG has the advantage of being easy to learn and run, some classes / blog posts can be very esoteric for people who are not diehard homebrewers. I'm trying to make this class a fun way for a player to bring a new friend to the table! The shared HP pool makes it durable and each of them can always multiclass after the first template to differenciate each other.

*THIS IS A CLASS FOR TWO PLAYERS PLAYING ONE CHARACTER*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A one-handed weapon of your choice, and your choice of a bag of rocks, a distinctive helmet or a blowhorn

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
"Your other half" and your choice of Smashing, Smelling or Arguing

For every Two-Headed Giant template you have, you gain 1 daily collaboration dice (D6).

**A:** Half of One, Collaborate<br>
**B:** Selves-Preservation<br>
**C:** Help Me Help You<br>
**D:** Us vs Them<br>

## Half of One
You are half of a two-headed giant. You and your other half each have created a character with this class, but you share the same body. Because of that, you share HP and inventory, and take the space of two humans. However, you still have control of your own head and one arm: one of you is always awake, but you can only each use one-handed objects.

You must decide together where you move, but you otherwise each play your halves separately.

## Collaborate
When your other half would fail something, you can roll one collaboration dice to give them a bonus equal to your roll.

## Selves-Preservation
You can spend one collaboration dice and add it to your damage roll against a thing that has hurt your other half.

## Help Me Help You
When your other half spends their last collaboration dice, you recover one collaboration dice.

## Us vs Them
When your other half attacks, you can attack too.
