*Three-armed celtic giant that wakes the earth.*

###### Humanoid. Adapted from [Mystara](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/gianatha.html)

Imagine a huge, hulking humanoid with tusks, pink skin, red hair, and, unsettlingly, a third arm sprouting out of its belly. It can feel where laylines are.

**HD:** 7+7  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** huge &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 4 / 8 / 3 / 7 / 3 <br>
**Armor:** as leather <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** reckless <br>

**Gigantophobia:** An athach must make save when seeing a huge of bigger creature, or be frightened.

**Attacks:** Each round, the athach bird can perform three of these actions:

<ins>Punch</ins>. The athach makes one melee attack (x).

<ins>Iron Apple Flail</ins>. The athach makes one melee attack (x). On a failed save, the target is pushed back and knocked prone.

<ins>Grapple</ins>. The athach makes one grapple attempt.

<ins>Stinky Bite</ins>. The athach bites (x) one grappled target, which must make a save vs poison or be dazed until the athachâ€™s next turn.

<ins>Layline Awakening</ins>. The athach chooses two small natural features. All creatures and objects standing between them take magical damage (x), or half if they dodge it. All further uses of the ability during this battle affects the original area of effect.
