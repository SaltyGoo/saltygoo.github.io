<img align="right" width=220px src="/images/BrainGolem.png" style="border:5px solid black">

Animated brain automaton with destructive psychic powers. A large construct.

_Imagine gray matter molded in a rough humanoid shape, towering at 8 feet tall. It’s held together by an inch deep layer of gelatinous translucent ooze. Being close gives you a headache._

_Limited genius, Unnerving power, Wet weight._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 5 | **Armor:** as chain  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal    |   | 

It is **immune** to [fatigue](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and diseases (because it's an object). 
It **resists** mind effects and magic.
It **can** detect any creature with a language, even through walls.
**However**, anti-magic zones and dispel effects paralyze it.
**Also**, its powerful numbing psychic aura causes creatures near it to only be able to do either an action OR move on their turn.

If the golem’s activation glyph isspecifically destroyed, the golem is deactivated. It can be altered to change its order. Roll a D12 for its location:

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
This is a streamlining of Arnold K's amazing take on the [golem](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/golems.html). Brain golems are a bit silly, which is their charm, i made them have psychic powers that are complementary to other psychic monsters. — SaltyGoo
