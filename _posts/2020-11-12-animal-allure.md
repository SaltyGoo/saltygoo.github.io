R: 60â€™		D: [dice]*10 minutes

You may charm up to [dice] HD of [animal], the victims enthralled with no save. You also gains the ability to engage in limited communication and, whilst the animals cannot be commanded, they will be positively disposed to assist you.

If there are no [animal] when you cast this spell, if there are any in the area, they will arrive in 2D10 minutes (potentially after the spell expired).

If you invest 4 dices or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent and they become followers.
