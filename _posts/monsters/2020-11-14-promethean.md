Most prometheans carry their bronze axe, shield and armor, but they are all oversized. Roll a D6 six times, you find:

1. Nothing
2. Nothing
3. Nothing.
4. A gourd full of mercury.
5. A bronze piece of oversized jewelery worth a [purse of gold](/2024/06/26/currency/).
6. A fragment of tablet from the times before (get 3 and start a heresy).
