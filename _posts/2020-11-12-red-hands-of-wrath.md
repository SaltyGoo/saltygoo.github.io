R: 60’		D: 10 minutes

You swap target hands with a wrathful devil’s claws dealing [dice]D6 damage. They cannot be used for anything else than violence and have a will of their own, but an unwilling target is allowed a save to resist the effect. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the effect becomes permanent.ou query a creature from another dimension. You can ask [dice] questions and they can ask as many. Answers are not guaranteed to be truthful, and entities will usually attempt to further their own interests. If a particular true name is known, it may be intoned during the casting of this spell, and the named creature will answer. Be careful of the information you give.
