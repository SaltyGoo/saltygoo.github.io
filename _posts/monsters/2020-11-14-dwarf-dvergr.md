title: Dwarf, Dvergr
---

Deep earth fascist dwarves. An humanoid.

Imagine a 4’ short humanoid with rocky gray skin, dark eyes and hair that seem made of steel wool. It dresses in drab work clothes that are often studded. Its heart is made of dark crystal.

**HD:** 1 + 2HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as equiped <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** sturdy, emotionally stunted <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

Dvergrs do not need light in the dark, as they smell everything that is crafted or carved. Their dark crystal heart make them resistant to mind attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>War Pick.</ins> The dvergr makes a melee attack (1D6).

<ins>Crossbow.</ins> The dvergr makes a ranged attack (1D12). It must take a turn recharging the crossbow before using it again.

<ins>Resize.</ins> The dvergr can become large or tiny. Increasing or reducing its HP by 50%, respectively, and increasing or reducing its melee damage dice size.
