Killing a dingonek is very dangerous but it can feed a village and many weapons can be made from its hide: scale armor, clubs and spears, etc. but the most precious is without doubt its poison.

The dingonek is a cryptid from kenya described as a giant saber-toothed semi-aquatic armadillo. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) chooses to give it poison. I imagined it like some sort of hippo-ankylosaur. â€” SaltyGoo </details>
