title: Garradalaigh, Audreena
---

Weird chimera that trades magical good deeds for the gift of mammal friendship. A large fey.

_Imagine for a moment a winged unicorn, except this one seems way off upon closer inspection: six legs, four goat eyes, a horn more akin to a rhinoceros’s, fleshy wings, and a neck that is actually a caterpillar’s body._

_Silent wisdom, Equine strength, Arcane majesty._

It **resists** mundane weapons and spells (because it's a fairy).
It **can** speak telepathically with any warm-blooded creature, breathe underwater, a see very well.
**Also**, as a imaginary creature, willpower must be used for attack rolls against it instead of dexterity.
Out of combat, it can cast divination and illusion-themed **magic**, and it knows who all wizards are.

<summary>Salvaging the Body</summary>

So this thing was real in the end and you killed it. Its flesh is a potent hallucinogenic that lasts days.

<span class="alchemy">**Garradalaigh Flesh**. You can see figments of your imagination as real for 1D4 days, but you can only describe them as subject and verb, with the referee finishing the description.</span>

Accepting and audreena’s boon will inspire a wizard to write a spell with the word *Speach* in it.

<span class="alchemy">**Audreena Boon**.  Allows you to speak with all warm blooded creatures.</span>

<summary>Credits</summary>
Garradalaighs are weird creations of the TSR Birthright setting made for AD&D 2e. I really love to discover new monsters like this one which really seems rooted in mythology but isn't. My adaptation is true to the original, if a bit simplified in its stats. It's as if these monsters were already contemporary in their originality.</details>
