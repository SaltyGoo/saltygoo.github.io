*This class is an adaptation of Phlox's amazing [take on the class](http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-barbarian.html), which goes back to the origin of its name: a foreigner. Compared to the original class, I kept Cultural Context and Outsider as-is and simplified the rest. â€” SaltyGoo*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
One **Object from Home**

<ins>Starting Skills</ins><br>
Foreign Lands and your choice of Explorer, Diplomat, Refugee.

For every Barbarian template you have, you gain one extra **Object from Home** (which means you get a second one at level 1).

**A:** Cultural Context<br>
**B:** Outsider<br>
**C:** How You Do It, Lose 1 drawback<br>
**D:** Paragon, Lose 1 drawback<br>

## Object from Home
An object from home can be a weapon, a piece of armour, or a tool with a specific fonction which can be social. For locals, they look weird and distinctively foreign. 

In your hands, a weapon from home's damage dice is one size bigger than the local equivalent, a piece of armour from home provides +1 armor, and you have advantage when you use a tool from home.

## Cultural Context
You find yourself in a society with wildly different expectations than normal. As such, you seem miraculous to others in some ways and foolish in others. Roll five times on each table below and choose four of the results for each. Remember, all of these are relative to the world you find yourself in now. If you are ignorant of laws, it may be because your home has no legal system, because it has outgrown the need for laws, or has laws so different as to provide unhelpful assumptions for this legal system.

## Outsider
It's obvious to everyone who sees you that you are not from around here. You can always find someone to explain what's happening, find people looking for disposable assistance, and find people interested in foreign cultures. In other words, in a crowd, you can always find someone for whom you are not a threat (three is a crowd).

## How You Do It
You can repair a broken **Object from Home** during a rest period. Your followers gain the same benefits as you if they use one of your **Object from Home**.
