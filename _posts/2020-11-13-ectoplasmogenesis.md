**R**: Touch  **D**: [dice] * minutes

Conjures ectoplasm to restore a damaged object to temporary wholesomeness. The max size of the object is [dice] x 5 square feet of material. The restoration happens fast enough that, for example, if you buried spear splinters beneath the floor they'd impale hapless bandits walking over them when restored. Ectoplasmic objects inflict magical damage.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanente.
