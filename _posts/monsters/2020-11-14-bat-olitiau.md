| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 4 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** special  |
| **Move:** normal, fly fast     |   | 

It **can** hear very well, allowing it to easily spot their preys in the dark, even invisible ones. 

In a swarm, creatures are **immune** to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and **resist** mind and weapon damage. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Rake</ins>. To dodge a swarmâ€™s attack, the roll has to beat 10 + the swarm's HP. On a hit the target takes damage (1D6) and must save vs poison or start [dying](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

The olitiau is a cryptid from Cameroon described as a giant toothy bat. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) gave it a smaller size (rare!) and made it a disease carrier. Maybe it's because I'm writing this in the middle of a pandemic, but I like that diseases become a real threat in DnD.
