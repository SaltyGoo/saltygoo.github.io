###### A monster class for the [Ettin](/monsters/ettin), a two-headed giant. Image by Jim Holloway.

**This class if for two players sharing one body!**

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A one-handed weapon of your choice, Half an Outfit, and your choice of a Bag of Bricks, a distinctive Helmet or a Blowhorn.

"Your other half" and your choice of Smashing, Smelling or Arguing.

For every Two-Headed Giant template you have, you gain 1 daily **Collaboration Die** (D6).

**A:** Half of One, Collaborate<br>
**B:** Selves-Preservation<br>
**C:** Help Me Help You<br>
**D:** Us vs Them<br>

## Half of One
You are one half of a two-headed giant. You and your other half each have created a character with this class, but you share the same body. Because of that, you pool HP and Inventory slots, and occupy the space of two humans. However, you still have control of your own head and one arm: one of you is always awake, but you each can only use one-handed objects.

You must decide together where you move, but you otherwise each play your halves separately. Whenever one of you must make a movement/climb/swim/etc roll, the other must too. One failure means both fail. Coordinating those limbs is hard!

## Collaborate
When your other half would fail something, you can roll one **Collaboration Die** to give them a bonus equal to your roll.

## Selves-Preservation
You can spend one **Collaboration Die** and add it to one of your damage rolls against a thing that has hurt your other half.

## Help Me Help You
When your other half spends their last **Collaboration Die**, you recover one **Collaboration Die**.

## Us vs Them
When your other half attacks on their turn, you can attack too.
