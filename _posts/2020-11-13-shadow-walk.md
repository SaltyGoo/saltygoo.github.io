**R**: 60'  **D**: [dice] rounds

You link two shadows you can see within range into a portal. If somebody steps into one, they pop out from the other. Each shadow must be bigger than the thing crossing it.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
