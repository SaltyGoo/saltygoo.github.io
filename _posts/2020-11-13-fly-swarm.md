**R**: 60'  **D**: [sum] rounds

_Dipteramorphosis_

Create a 30' cloud of flies. In it, actions that rely on sight are made with disadvantage. Living creatures under 50% HP must make a save every round they spend in it or catch [Rat-Bite Fever](/monsters/rat).

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent and follows you.
