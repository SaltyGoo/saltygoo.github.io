OSR DnD rules compiled and adapted from Arnold K's [Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG)](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html).

# **How to Play**

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a D20 and add a number from your character sheet to the result. If the total is 16 or above, your character succeeds what they intended to do. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

# **Creating a Character**

Roll 3D6 six times, halve the results and note them rounded down. These are, in order, your stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.

Your HP is equal to your Constitution. Your Movement is equal to your Strength

Choose a [class](https://saltygoo.github.io/classes/). Add the class’s starting equipment, skills and its first template (A) abilities to your character sheet.

# Stats & Skills

<ins>Strength</ins> represents your physical prowess. It affects the number of things you can carry and your melee attacks.

<ins>Dexterity</ins> represents your balance, precision and reflexes. It affects your ranged attacks and your chances to dodge attacks.

<ins>Constitution</ins> represents your health. It affects your durability and the number of scars you can bear.

<ins>Intelligence</ins> represents your knowledge and capacity to learn. It affects the number of skills you can have.

<ins>Wisdom</ins> represents your instinct and willpower. It is used to resist many spells and affects your combat order.

<ins>Charisma</ins> represents your personality. It is used to for social intereactions and affects the number of followers you can hav.

<ins>HP</ins> (or Hit Points) is the amount of hits you can take before getting [Wounded](#combat).

<ins>Movement</ins> might be for climbing, jumping, or rolled against a monster’s movement when trying to escape it. When trying to escape, failure means the battle has simply moved to another location.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example</summary>
*Beau is running away from a troll. He rolls his movement and the referee rolls the troll's movement. Beau gets 17 and the troll gets 13, this means beau is out of reach in another location of his choice. However, Gretchen, Beau's ally, rolled 12. That means she hasn't escaped the troll, and both of them will have to keep fighting in the next room the dungeon.*
</details>

<ins>Armor</ins> is the amount of damage you ignore on each attack, to a minimum of 1.

A <ins>Skill</ins> can be anything (flower arrangement, rolling dices, etc). When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you use if it would thematically make sense. You can have as many Skills as your Intelligence.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Example</summary>
*Beau has 3 points of Charisma and 5 points of a skill named "Swamp Dweller". When trying to seduce the troll, the referee asks him to roll charisma, but Beau argues that his Swamp Dweller skill makes as much sense to use. The referee agrees and beau adds 5 to his roll instead of 3.*

# Rolling

When the referee tells you to roll one stat (Strength, when climbing a cliff for example), roll a D20, add your stat, and, if the total is higher than 15, you succeed. 

A referee should only call for a roll when both success and failure have interesting consequences. Bashing a door, for example, might take moments on a success, and 10 minutes on a failure, attracting monsters to the noise.

A contested roll is when the referee rolls using the monster’s stats and you have to roll higher.

Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best. Disadvantage is the opposite.

# Combat

<ins>Turn Order:</ins> In order of Wisdom.

<ins>Your Turn:</ins> On your turn, your character can move nearby, talk, shout, drop an object or themselves, and do any other one comabt action, which can be moving further.

<ins>Attacking:</ins> To attack, roll Strength (or Dexterity for ranged weapons). The monster will roll Dexterity. You hit if you roll higher. Alternatively, if you want less rolls, the number to beat is 10 plus the target's dexterity.

When you hit, roll your weapon’s damage and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it. 

Rolling 20 on attack means do double damage. Rolling 20 on dodge means you get a free attack.

# Dying & Healing

Every point of damage you take below 0 HP counts as a Wound. When you gain a wound, you fall unconscious and start dying. If you reach 10 wounds, you die. Each wound reduces your maximum HP by 1, down to 0, until they are healed.

When you are dying, you must roll Constitution on each of your turns.
- On a roll of 1, your character dies. 
- On a failure, you gain 1 Wound. 
- On a success, nothing changes. 
- On a roll of 20 or on result of 24 or higher, you stabilize and stop dying.

Up to two allies can roll Intelligence to stabilize you. Expanding bandages gives a bonus of 2 on that roll. Stabilizing does not remove wounds.

<ins>Healing:</ins> A 8 hours rest heals all HP and stat losses and consumes 1 ration for the team.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care requires to play another character for 1 session and for the wounded character to spend this time in a safe space with healers.

# Inventory

You have as many inventory slots as twice your strength. Small items like potions and daggers can be stacked in packs of 3. Ammunition, in stacks of 12. Each item above your limit lowers your Movement by 1.

It takes an action to retrieve an item, unless it is in your first 3 slots.

# Leveling Up

In your adventures you will find objects, the most precious of which are Treasures. By spending a Treasure carousing, a character can level up. It gains +2 HP and you can select a new class template (up to 4 total). 

Choose a stat, increase it by 1 (up to 10).

After level 4, you get 1 Mastery point instead of any template or bonus.

<ins>Mastery:</ins> You gain a Mastery point when you level up beyond level 4 or bring a skill or a stat to 10. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting an adjacent ally at a rate of 1 point for 1 point.
