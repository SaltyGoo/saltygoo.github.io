<summary>Design Notes</summary>
This was initially a monster class for the [Calytaur](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/calytaur). I really like how many OSR systems represents exta weight as inventory slots and I wanted to play with this mechanic for a class based on the tropes of the pigs. The end result is, I hope, a pretty versatile and fun class with a twist on resource management.

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Lumberjack axe or meat cleaver, leather armor, jug of mud.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Butchery, Debauchery or Farming.

For every Pigfolk template you have, you get more fat (it takes one inventory slot)*.

**A:** Bulk I, Pig Nose I<br>
**B:** Bulk II, Iron Stomach<br>
**C:** Pig Nose II<br>
**D:** Stubbornness<br>

## Bulk
For each inventory slot you have taken by fat, increase your maximum HP by 1. When in town between adventures, each [Treasure](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) spent carousing can give you more fat if you want.

## Pig Nose I
You can smell/taste surrounding edible things. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors and this does not detect diseases and natural poisons.

## Bulk II
You can use the number of inventory slots you have taken by fat instead of your strength score.  When in town between adventures, each [Valuable](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) spent carousing can give you more fat if you want.

## Iron Stomach
If you are poisoned, you can burn one inventory slot of fat to recover from it.

## Pig Nose II
After you eat something, you know if there are other things like it in the dungeon and in which general direction they are. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors.

## Stubbornness
You can burn one inventory slot of fat to reroll any roll you are unhappy with.
