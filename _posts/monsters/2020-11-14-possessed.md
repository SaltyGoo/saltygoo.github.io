##### From various religions.

**Fear demon inside a mortal body.** Unstable in this world. Sometimes seen sharing their habitat with [lemures](/monsters/lemure). A horror.

_Imagine a normal human. Sweating profusely. In pain. Bruised and sickly body. Unhinged joints. Bloodshot eyes and yellow teeth._

| -------- | --------|
| **Hit Points:** 9 | **Armor:** as worn |
| **Hit it:** normal  | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal, climb normal  |  **Size:** medium | 

The possessed **can** see through all mirrors it has seen since the last moon, and it regenerates 1D6 Hit Points per turn. As long as it is possessing a body, the possessing demon **cannot** die. It has the following **weaknesses** that allow it to die:

- being doused with holy water;
- being forced to look at its own reflection;
- being screamed by at least 3 adjacent people.

**Attacks (2/round)**

<ins>Reckless Stab</ins> The possessed makes a melee attack with advantage (1D8). The target has advantage attacking the possessed until its next turn.

<ins>Mind Assault</ins> A target the possessed can see must save or have its next turn controlled by the possessed. If a target is frightened by the possessed, it has disadvantage on its save. A target who is controled two turns in a row becomes the possessed and the previous body collapses dying.

<ins>Disturbing Babble</ins> Everybody who can hear the possessed must save or be [frightened](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) by it.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Study It (1D6 Mutations)</summary>
  
If you have disected or conversed with this horror, you can spend the equivalent of 4 bags of gold to feverishly study the thing between two adventures and discover weird knowledge beyond reality. If you do so, your studies of the aberration will change you in horrible, gruesome ways. Roll 1D6 for each gold cost spent this way. 

1. ... you are possessed.
1. ... your head turns 360 degrees. You can take damage while dying and not die.
1. ... you can walk backwards upside down on any surface.
1. ... your teeth are yellow. You can spit bile on two adjacent targets and inflict 2D6 acid damage. Costs a ration.
1. ... you are gaunt a perpetualy bleeding. You know the spell [Soul Transfer](/2020/11/13/souls-transfer/) and can cast it for 1 Spell Die for free. 
1. roll again. You can permanently change one word from one of your class abilities or known spell to “Possess”.
