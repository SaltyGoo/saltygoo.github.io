---

Mix [valuable](/2020/11/10/extra-rules#treasures) oil and water in a shallow plate while pleading Fate, Chance and the Gods to deliver a victim from a curse or any negative spell. The victim can be a creature, object or area. If [dice] is at least equal to the level of the curse, the curse will be lifted. If not, it still will be, but only after the victim (or a postulant if the curse afflicts an item or place) performs a specific act determined by the Referee: 

- Completes a pilgrimage .
- Offers appropriate sacrifices, worth at least a Treasure per victim, often more. 
- Makes appropriate amends.
