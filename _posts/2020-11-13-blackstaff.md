**D**: Sigil

You place your Sigil on a staff or cudgel, traditionally taken from a sloe. Your skill witht this staff equals to at least 5 + [dice], and, if you hit a cursed, charmed, petrified or fey creature with it, roll damage twice and take the best result. Only you or a creature that has slain you can use your staff.
