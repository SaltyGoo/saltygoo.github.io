*Centaur ghost riders of doom. Undead.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Originally named the bestial beast by its creator [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), the bestial terror is basically a spectral centaur. On top of the spectral trample, I added typical centaur attacks: it was realy important for me that the beasts were able to drag mortals to the underworld. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine the ghost of a centaur wearing a terrifying faceless spiked helm. Whenever its hooves hit the floor, it echoes like thunder and black smoke rises from the ground.

**HD:** 3  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / 7 / 8 / 4 / 7 / 6  <br>
**Immunities:** acid, blunt, cold, fatigue, grapple, petrification, pierce, poison, slash, sleep<br>
**Resistances:** all damage except magic <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** reckless <br>

The bestial terror sees in the dark. If it is hit by sunlight, it loses all damage resistances and immunities.

**Terror Stampede:** If the bestial terror moves its full movement in its turn, everybody who hears must save or be frightened. A creature is immune to this effect for 24h after a successful save.

**Attacks:** Each round, the bestial terror can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Charge</ins>. The bestial terror charges in a straight line and attacks a target with its hooves and pike. If the target doesn’t dodge, it takes (2x) damage and is knocked prone.

<ins>Pike Drag</ins>. The bestial terror makes one melee attack (x) and may move nearby with the target.

<ins>Trample</ins>. The bestial terror makes two melee attacks (x) against different targets. It does not provoke attacks of opportunities this turn.

<ins>Longbow</ins>. The bestial terror makes two ranged attacks (x).
