**D**: [dice] hours

_Felimorphosis_

A target creature that you have personally drawn the blood of is cursed with relentless assaults from [jaguars](/monsters/panther). Over the course of the spell, Jaguars will pounce from any nearby shadow upon the target. Any time the Jaguar is killed, another will immediately spawn. Every hour an additional Jaguar will spawn. The target may avoid this by being in a space with absolutely no shadow. After the time is up, the Jaguars all vanish. Jaguars disperse into shadow-stuff when killed, leaving no remains.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
