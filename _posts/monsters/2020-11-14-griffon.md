<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 3 [bags of gold](/2024/06/26/currency/) in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Griffon feathers make prized quills, and their pelt is often worn by kings, but killing such a beast would be sacrilege: they are worth much more tamed. Lucky you if you find an egg.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
