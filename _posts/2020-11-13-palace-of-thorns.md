title: Palace of Thorns

**D**: [sum] minutes

A creature you can see is suddenly overcome by a creeping paranoia. Everything is sharp, bristling with pale marble thorns. They’re tucked under the petals of flowers, in the mouths of lovers, everywhere but their own clothes and skin. Every time they touch anything, they must save or take 1d4 damage. This damage can’t kill them, and if they survive long enough for the enchantment to wear off, it’s all undone. Every other [die] you invest increase the damage die by one step.
