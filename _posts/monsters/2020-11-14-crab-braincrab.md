Braincrabs are hermit crabs that live in skulls. A tiny beast.

_Imagine a skull, something moves in its eye sockets and eyestalks probe the area. As it sees you, multiple sharp legs unfold under it._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 | **Armor:** as leather  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** slow, swim slow     |   | 

It **can** detect nearby movement, breathe underwater, walk on any surface, even upside down and also jump up to 10’ without a running start. 
It **can’t** see well.
**Also**, it is indistinguishable from a normal skull when not moving.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Pinch.</ins> The braincrab makes a melee attack. If the target is [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), it inflicts Willpower damage (1D4).

<ins>Skullclamp.</ins> The braincrab jumps and attempts to [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) a target. On success the target is [blinded](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions). A missed attack on a grappling braincrab has 1/2 chance to hit the grappled creature.

<ins>Numbing Saliva.</ins> One grappled target must make a save vs poison or be [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for 1 minute.

# Braincrab Swarm

|  <span style="display: inline-block; width:250px"></span>  |  |
| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 0 +4D4HP | **Armor:** as leather  |
| **Hit it:** easy    | **Dodge it:** special  |
| **Move:** slow     |   | 

It **can** detect nearby movement, breathe underwater, walk on any surface, even upside down and also jump up to 10’ without a running start. 
It **can’t** see well.
**Also**, it is indistinguishable from a skull pile when not moving.

In a swarm, creatures are **immune** to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and **resist** mind and weapon damage. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Swarm.</ins> To dodge a swarm’s attack, the roll has to beat 10 + the swarm's HP. On a hit the target takes 1 damageand the same amount of Braincrabs is attached to the victim (see Braincrab above).

If you are careful to extract the venom glands, the braincrab is as edible as a normal crab. You need as many crabs as there are players to make a day's ration. Many underdark and sea dwelling creatures have learned to coat their weapons in their juices.

<summary>Credits</summary>
A creation of [Richard J. Leblanc](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), I adapted the braincrab to be less save or die, and more a slow painful death from a thousand needles.
