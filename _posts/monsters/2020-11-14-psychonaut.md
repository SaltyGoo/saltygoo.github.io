##### From Garamondia's [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-optical-dungeonthe-process-dungeon.html)

**Immaterial psychic beings traveling the physical word in porcelain suits.** A curious walking psychic apocalypse. Lonely, curious, insane. Disposition of an astronaut on an alien world. A medium horror.

_Something with disturbingly human proportions that crawled up from the centre of the earth centuries ago. It is encased head-to-toe in delicate, pale, ceramic armour._

The psychonaut is protected by a completely sealed armor. While the armor is intact, the psychonaut is **immune** to damage. Instead, every time it is hit, its armor chips and is reduced by 1 and is destroyed if it reaches 0.

While the armor is broken, the psychonaut is **immune** to physical damage, but loses 1D4 HP per round.

The psychonaut projects a terrible **aura** that [stuns](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) every living creature within 30' of it. A creature can make a strength save at the beginning of its turn to be [dazed](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) this turn instead.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Psychic Crush</ins>. Every creature in the psychonaut's aura takes 1D8 mind damage.
