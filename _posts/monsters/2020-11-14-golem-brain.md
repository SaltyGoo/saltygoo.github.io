<img align="right" width=220px src="/images/BrainGolem.png" style="border:5px solid black">

Animated brain automaton with destructive psychic powers. A construct.

Imagine gray matter molded in a rough humanoid shape, towering at 8 feet tall. It’s held together by an inch deep layer of gelatinous translucent ooze. Being close gives you a headache.

**HD:** 5  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** very strong and sturdy, limited genius intellect <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

As a construct, the Brain Golem can be considered an object. It is *immune to fatigue and fear*. However, anti-magic zones and *dispel effects paralyze it*. Additionally, the Brain Golem is *resistant to mind and magic* and can detect all creatures nearby with an intelligence of 2 or higher, even through walls.

This type of golem is extremely intelligent, but its scope is limited to one one-sentence order at a time. Its powerful numbing psychic aura causes creatures near it to only be able to do either an action OR move on their turn.

The golem’s activation glyph is hidden among brain folds. If specifically destroyed, the golem is deactivated. It can be altered to change its order. Roll a D12 for its location:

<ins>Mind Pulse.</ins> Each creature in a large area around the brain golem must save or take mind damage (1D8) and be stunned for one round. It also recharges any other ability with the word psychic or mind in its name.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
This is a streamlining of Arnold K's amazing take on the [golem](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/golems.html). Brain golems are a bit silly, which is their charm, i made them have psychic powers that are complementary to other psychic monsters. — SaltyGoo
