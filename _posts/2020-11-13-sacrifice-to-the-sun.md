You shoot an arrow at a living target, setting it on fire. You have a [sum] bonus to your attack roll while doing so, and, if the target is willing, it takes [sum] extra fire damage.

If the sacrifical victim dies, it immolates in a massive fireball and deals [sum] x [HD] Fire damage to everything within range. This ignores the resistances and immunities of undeads or creatures considered to be “of the night.”
