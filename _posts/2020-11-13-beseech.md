This spell must be perfomed at a genuine shrine and involves doing a 10 minutes ritual.

Make a promise to the local god or spirit. It must involve upholding its values, as decided by the referee. In exchange, you get [dice] of the following favours:

- any one seal, barrier or lock of your choice is removed once for you and your friends
- any one fact of your choice is revealed to you
- 10 minutes of conversation with the spirit of a person of your choice, alive or dead
- one future reroll for a dying saving throw

If you do not achieve your promise within [dice] days, you gain 2 [Doom Points.](/list/spell-catastrophe) If your promise is behavioral (i.e. being chivalrous), you must have been the uncontested paragon of that behaviour in the area for the duration.
