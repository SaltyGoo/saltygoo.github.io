*Sentient giant floating hands specialized in abductions. Elemental.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Elementals can be so boring design-wise. As printed in the [AD&D 2e Monster Manual](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/elekaase.html), the aerial servant is simply a buffed-up air elemental with the added abilities of the invisible stalker, which is incidently a type of air elemental. Even its appearance is identical to the air elemental's. What I did here was remove the most glaring overlaps with the stalker and focused on the abduction aspect. Also I gave it an appearance that matches its low intelligence and its fonction as a servant. Not everything needs to be humanoid! — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a floating hand made of smoke and wind. Its movement are precise yet forcefull. It is very expressive. They are most often bound to gods, wizards or fey princesses, and resentfully do their bidding. 

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 10 / 10 / 7 / 3 / 5 / 3 <br>
**Immunities:** electricity, grapple, petrification, sleep <br>
**Resistances:** damage <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D8 <br>
**Movement:** fly fast &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The aerial servant loses all resistances if it is prone or cant move.

As a gaseous creature, it can fit into any hole. It always knows the exact location of its target if it is clearly identified.

**Attacks:** Each round, the aerial servant can perform two of these actions:

<ins>Crush</ins>. The aerial servant makes a melee attack (x).

<ins>Ethereal Shift</ins>. The servant shifts between the ethereal and physical worlds. It is visible in either, but cant affect or be affected by anything in the plane it isn’t. 

<ins>Smother</ins>. The servant attempts to grapple an adjacent target. If grappled, a creature cannot breathe. Only one creature can be grappled at a time.

<ins>Push</ins>. The servant pushes a creature. If the target fails a strength save, it is blown away nearby, falls prone, and takes damage (x) on impact.

## Binding the Elemental

You gain a [Spell Dice](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spells), one Doom Point and ...

1. ... your lungs are crushed, giving you a permanent level of fatigue.
1. ... you are transported into the ether.
1. ... all air elementals suddenly knows your exact location. 
1. ... you can see the ethereal border.
1. ... you hover.
1. ... the spell word *Capture*.

If you roll a catastrophe, the elemental is released.

## Conjuring an Aerial Servant

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 4 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Aerial Servant** <br>
R: 20’ D: [dice] days

The summon has one task only: retrieve the person or object you want dead or alive after which it is banished back to the plane of air. It is bound to complete this task as fast as possible, but will try to kill you along the way if it doesn’t slow it down.
