**R**: 90â€™ 		**D**: [dice] rounds

Fire bends to your will. You expand or move a flame to cover [dice] x 5 square feet of flammable surfaces, inflicting [dice] damage every round to anybody caught in it.

Alternatively, you can reduce a fire by the same size, up to a candle light.

At any moment, you can detonate the flames, inflicting [sum] damage to everybody in a 30' area.

This spell can be used to control a fire elemental like a puppet instead if it fails a save.
