<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
*This was initially a monster class for the [Centaur](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/centaur) but seems like it could be used for an actual horse. It's a good fighting class, and it becomes very absurd if you multiclass into a specialist (wall-climbing horse-person!). â€” SaltyGoo*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A waterskin and two of the followings: a Bow (and 12 arrows), a Saddle, or a Songbird,

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Outdoors, Horse Life or Archery.

For every Centaur template you have, increase your HP and Movement by 1.

**A:** Half-Horse, Hooves I<br>
**B:** Ride or Die, Star Map<br>
**C:** Charge, Mentor of Heroes<br>
**D:** Hooves II<br>

## Half-Horse
- You can have one human sized rider OR carry as many extra inventory slots as your STR.
- You do not add your movement score to climbing, crawling, and swimming rolls.
- You do not fit in crawl spaces.

## Hooves I
You can attack with your hooves, inflicting 1D6 damage and shoving on a failed save.

## Ride or Die
You and your rider can take a hit for one another.

## Star Map
Once per day, you and your team can skip through a arctic, desert or grassland hex when you travel.

## Charge
If you charge in a straight line towards a target, you and your rider's next melee attack against it this turn inflicts an extra 1D6 damage and you can use your MOV score instead of your STR for your attack roll.

## Mentor of Heroes
When you gain a skill point for your [heroic deeds](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#heroism--scars), one of your teammates can also add 1 point to the same skill if they want.

## Hooves II
You can make your Hooves attack on top of another attack each round.
