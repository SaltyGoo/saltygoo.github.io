## Heroism & Scars

###### Inspired by Arnold K's [Legendarium](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-legendarium-diagetic-advancement.html)

<ins>Heroism.</ins> After a session, note one heroic thing you did. You can add 1 to a Skill that directly relates to this gesture. You can only know as many skills as your Intelligence. You can replace old skills as you get new ones.


<ins>Scars.</ins> Also, after a session, note one brush with death you’ve had. You now have a scar and advantage against that specific danger (as defined by the referee). You can only have as many scars and mutations as your Constitution.  You can replace old scars as you get new ones, but not mutations.

## Damage Types

For those who want to do more with their melee weapons:
- <ins>Blunt:</ins> You can reduce your damage dice by 1 size (1D8>1D6>1D4 etc) and attempt to shove as part of your attack.
- <ins>Piercing:</ins> A *prone* or *suprised* target takes double damage.
- <ins>Slashing:</ins> When you roll max damage, you can make another attack.

For those who want to do more with the elements, you can sacrifice a damage dice to have a powerful on-hit effect instead:
- <ins>Acid:</ins> negate target's armor for a round.
- <ins>Cold:</ins> prevent movement for a round.
- <ins>Electric:</ins> attack a nearby target for the sacrificed dice's damage.
- <ins>Fire:</ins> inflict 1 damage per round untill snuffed.
- <ins>Mind:</ins> target acts last on its next turn.
- <ins>Magical:</ins> must save to a cast spells next round.
- <ins>Poison:</ins> is poisoned for a round.

<span class="alchemy">*Margh the Vile casts a spell inflicting 2D6 electric damage to a goblin. She can choose to inflict 1D6 damage instead and attack another nearby goblin for 1D6 damage. Boo Son of Jean has a sword of frost inflicting 1D8 damage, but the monster is immune to cold. Instead, he sacrifes the D8. On a hit, the monster's feet are frozen to the ground for a round.*</span>

###### **Design Note:** Armor can be very hard to overcome in this GLoG hack. I wanted to represented the tried an true medieval tactic of pushing armored on the floor and stabbing them to death to be a viable way to that. Also, sneak attack is now linked to piercing damage and cleave to slashing. As for the elemental damages, they aim to provide tactical options for a well coordinated team.

## Stat Damage

Various monsters and spells can damage your stats instead of your HP. Here is what happens when one of your stats reaches 0:

<ins>Strength:</ins> you are Stunned, yet can talk.<br>
<ins>Dexterity:</ins> you are Prone and cant stand.<br>
<ins>Constitution:</ins> you are Dying.<br>
<ins>Intelligence:</ins> you are Dazed and mute.<br>
<ins>Wisdom:</ins> you are mad, you become a hostile NPC.<br>
<ins>Charisma:</ins> you are forgotten. Nobody, even friends, can help you in any way.

---

## Conditions

<ins>Blinded:</ins> Cannot see. You are disadvantaged on your attacks and Dexterity. Others are advantaged on their attacks.

<ins>Charmed:</ins> You cannot attack, hurt or say anything bad to or about the source of the charm. You fail all rolls against it. 

<ins>Confused:</ins> Each round, you must declare three potential actions that are fully distinct from each other (no shared objects or verbs). Roll 1D3 and do one randomly.

<ins>Cursed:</ins> You cannot benefit from any magic.

<ins>Dazed:</ins> You can act OR move on your turn.  

<ins>Deafened:</ins> You cant hear. Your teammates cannot talk to you.

<ins>Dying:</ins> See [combat](/2020/11/09/base-rules#combat).

<ins>Fatigued:</ins> -1 to all stats. Cumulative.

<ins>Frightened:</ins> You cannot interact with the source of your fear until you have spent a full turn without seeing it. Roll a D6: 1, drop whatever you are holding; 2, scream; 3, fall prone; 4, grapple closest ally or object; 5, you are stunned for one turn; 6, run away.

<ins>Grappled:</ins> Cannot move.

<ins>Invisible:</ins> Advantage on attack rolls and stealth. Attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

<ins>Petrified:</ins> You are stunned. You resist the first 10 damage of each attack.

<ins>Poisoned:</ins> You are disadvantaged in all your actions. Poisons, diseases and other substances have other unique effects depending on the source.

<ins>Prone:</ins> You are easier to hit in melee, but harder at range. You cannot attack very well nor move very fast. Standing up takes all your movement for the turn.

<ins>Stunned:</ins> You skip your turn and you fail all Strength and Dexterity rolls. Melee attacks automatically hit you, ranged ones have advantage.

## Rare Metals

A good monster hunter knows which weapon to bring to slay which beast. Different metals have the potential to overcome a beast’s most impervious resistances.

<ins>Adamantium:</ins> Nothing is more solid than adamantium. An object hit by adamantium takes double damage, including constructs. An adamantium object is unbreakable.

<ins>Cold Iron:</ins> A faerie that touches cold iron loses all abilities and resistances for a turn. They can smell it.

<ins>Silver:</ins> Silvered weapons ignore all the resistances of undead creatures and creatures that are not in their true form.

<ins>Mithral:</ins> Is light like cloth. Weapons made of mithral can be used with Dexterity. Armors made of mithral do not penalize Dexterity.

<ins>Radium:</ins> Radium sheds light like a candle. It ignore the resistances of celestial creatures. Will poison mortals over time.

<ins>Platinum:</ins> Platinum repairs itself. Platinum weapons ignore the resistances of aberrationns, as well as their save to kill ability.

## Traveling

Inside a dungeon, any worthwhile action takes 10 minutes. Roll for encounters every 30 minutes. Ask the players to choose odd or even, if they lose, one torch or lantern is depleted.

On the world map, crossing a hex takes half a day. Roll for encounters twice per day. Environmental penalties can happen.

---

## Treasures

In a dungeon, you can find Valuables, Treasures, and Great Treasures. Each take 1 inventory slot. Valuables can be traded to buy things 1:1. Treasures can be traded to buy expensive things. Great Treasures are unique and worth 4 treasures. None of these have any utility besides trade and leveling up.

---

## Between Adventures

Leveling up is just one way of gaining new powers. This is where you can convert treasures in character levels. If one of the following options allow you to roll on a table, you can roll once per treasure spent and choose the outcome you prefer.

Spend Treasures to **carouse**! <br>
You will attract new (non-combatant) [followers](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html "Coins and Scrolls"), but there is a risk you end up partying a [bit too harde](https://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html "Jeff's Gameblog") if you fail a constitution roll. If 4 treasures are spent this way, **you level up!**

Spend Treasures to **build a base**!<br>
1 Treasure can build a basic 30'30' room, and one valuable can be traded for 1 piece of standard furniture.

Spend Treasures to **learn new skills**!<br>
As long as you can find somebody who is an expert in them. Spend 1 Treasure to learn a new skill (+4) or improve a skill you already know (+2). You can do that once per skill between each adventure. Alternatively, you can spend 2 Treasures to learn a new attack from a creature you can train with. Ask the referee.

Spend Treasures ot **hire new hirelings**!<br>
By default you have the choice between a specialist who can sneak and climb, or a fighter who comes equiped with armor and weapons. They have 0 hit points, 5 in all stats and are not suicidal. Each location can have more class options depending on the culture, at the referee's disctretion. Hireling spellcasters know 1 spell. Hiring somebody costs 1 treasure, and they expect to be paid 1 treasure per adventure.

<ins>Are you a magic user?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **research new spells**!<br>
1 Treasure spent in research allows to copy one spell from a scroll or spell book into your own spell book. Buying a spell scroll also costs 1 treasure.<br>
2 Treasures spent in research allow to create news spells by combining spells using [spell word](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spell-words).

<ins>Do you have access to the dead body of a beast, or other raw materials?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **craft**!<br>
Ask the referee what makes sense to do with the materials, but dont be afraid to give ideas. If 4 Treasures are spent crafting an object, it will be magical.

<ins>Do you have access to a living beast?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **tame it**!<br>
1 Treasure makes the creature friendly to 1 person. 1 Treasure teaches it a one-word order.

<ins>Do you have access to forbidden eldritch knowledge?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **research eldritch knowledge** and roll on their mutation tables. Some are even beneficial! Each Treasure gives you advantage on that roll.

<ins>Can you talk with a devil or celestial?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **negotiate a pact**: you'll get a gift and a quest. Each Treasure allows you to choose between more options for your gift and quest.

<ins>Do you have a manual about constructs? or access to a real speciment?</ins><br>
Spend Treasures to **build one**. 1 treasure equals 1 HD of construct.

<ins>Have you captured an elemental spirit?</ins><br>
Spend a Treasure to **bind it to you**: you'll get the power to cast more spells, at a price. Each treasure gives you advantage when rolling the price.

<ins>Have you access to necromantic tomes?</ins><br>
You could spend treasures to **become undead**.

All these tables are in the monster section held by the referee and should be negotiated with them. SoonTM
