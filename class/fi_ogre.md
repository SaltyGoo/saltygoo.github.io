<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Club, 2 Rations and a Big Pot.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Smashing and your choice of Food, Goblins or Bullying.

For every Ogre template you have, you grow 1â€™ tall and wide, giving you an extra Inventory slot filled with **Fat**.

**A:** Bulk, Smash<br>
**B:** Bully<br>
**C:** Lunch<br>
**D:** Strength of Food<br>

## Bulk
You can eat any object bigger than a chicken and softer than metal as a ration. If you don't eat at least two rations per day, you lose 1 layer of **Fat**.

For each inventory slot you have taken by **Fat**, increase your HP by 1. If you spend the equivalent of a Treasure [carousing](/2020/11/09/base-rules/), you can fill one of your Inventory slots with **Fat**.

## Smash
Your melee attacks inflict +1 damage per inventory slots you have taken by **Fat**.

## Bully
Once per encounter, you can give a one-word command to a humanoid that is smaller than you. The creature can choose to fall prone instead of obeying the order.

## Lunch
When you eat a ration, you can recover 1D6 HP. If you do, you need to eat an extra ration this day.

## Strength of Food
You take half damage from the last thing you ate and your rolls to destroy things like it are easy if it was an object. If it was a magic item, you gain its powers.
