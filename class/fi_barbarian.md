*This class is an adaptation of Phlox's amazing [take on the class](http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-barbarian.html), which goes back to the origin of its name: a foreigner. Compared to the original class, I kept Cultural Context and Outsider as-is and simplified the rest. â€” SaltyGoo*

A Weapon in a shape unheard of in this land, a piece of armor made from a material not found here, a trinket from home that signifies your faith or rank.

## Foreign Technique
When using a weapon uniquely from your homeland, you inflict an extra 1D4 damage. Pieces of armor made with materials from your homeland provide you with +1 armor.

## Cultural Context
You find yourself in a society with wildly different expectations than normal. As such, you seem miraculous to others in some ways and foolish in others. Roll five times on each table below and choose four of the results for each. Remember, all of these are relative to the world you find yourself in now. If you are ignorant of laws, it may be because your home has no legal system, because it has outgrown the need for laws, or has laws so different as to provide unhelpful assumptions for this legal system.
