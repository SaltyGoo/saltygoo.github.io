title: Bramble Burrow
---
D: 1 day

The spell digs a burrow under bramble or other undergrowth, and, despite the bareness, it is a safe and warm refuge. The entrance is privy only to your eyes, but you can guide in up to [dice] person. 

A back exit leads 1D6 miles in the direction of your choice. You do not know exactly where, but the exit must be hidden by vegetation. The burrow starts to collapse after 1 day or when you leave it.
