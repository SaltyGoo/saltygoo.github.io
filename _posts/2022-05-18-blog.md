title: Chtulhu Insanity with Messerspiel
---

Normally I'm just a lil glogger doing my lil glogger things without writing about them. But since I've just been doing layout design for the last months, I feel compelled to chat a bit.

My play group will be playing Call of Chtulhu instead of Glog-DnD this summer and I can't wait. Problem is, after having gotten used to the lightness of the GLOG rules, I couldn't go back to the pile of sub-systems that is Call of Chtulhu. [Xenophon of Athens](https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/) on the GLOG discord suggested I look at [Messerspiel](https://ozbrowning.itch.io/messerspiel) for inspiration. Messerspiel is a ultralight rpg ruleset that uses stress as its central component. The fit seemed so good, so I decided to go through the Chtulhu Keeper Rulebook and see if there were rules that couldn't be substituted by the Messerspiel system.

The only thing that stuck out to me was Sanity. So here is what I came with in the spirit of both Call of Chtulhu and Messerpiel:

## SANITY

When you lose **2 dice** in one session, you have a bout of madness for 10 minutes, after which the referee changes something in your character sheet.

When you lose **3 dice** or more in one session,the referee adds a phobia, a mania or a delusion to your character sheet. You ignore all die results of 6 if you are facing a phobia, ignoring a mania or denying a delusion.

When you lose your last die, your character becomes a NPC controlled by the referee. You recover 2 dice after solving a scenario or going through therapy.
