**R**: Touch		**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You enchant a potpourri with your sigil. For the duration of the spell, you can touch a diseased thing and trap the malady inside the potpourri. As long as you breathe the potpourri's aroma —through a plague-doctor's mask for example— you are immune to the diseases trapped in it. You can trap [dice] diseases that way.

You can also breathe it on adjacent things to contaminate them before the spell depletes after [dice] times. A save is allowed to resist each disease trapped in the mixture.
