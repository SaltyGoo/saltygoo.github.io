##### From Garamondia's [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-optical-dungeonthe-process-dungeon.html)

**Order eaters. High servants of chaos itself.**  They infiltrate worlds when its future becomes too certain and societies are in control of their destiny. Disposition: as a disciplined black ops. Hates religions. A large horror.

_Tall humanoids with 6 spined, oddly jointed insectoid limbs and heads like giant mosquitoes. They wear baroque suits of heavy armour made from a strange iridescent metal that rings when struck, and are absolutely covered in strange metallic jewellery and ornamentation._

The nomophage is an aberration. It can only be killed if the person doing the last blow succeeds on a save versus fear. If the killer fails, the nomophage survives with 1 HP, terribly mangled, and can move immediately.

The nomophage projects a terrible **aura** that [frightens](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) every living creature seeing it for the first time unless they fail a saving throw.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Study It (1D6 Mutations)</summary>
If you have disected or conversed with this horror, you can spend the equivalent of 6 bags of gold to feverishly study the thing between two adventures and discover weird knowledge beyond reality. If you do so, your studies of the aberration will change you in horrible, gruesome ways : Roll 1D6 for each bag spent this way.

1. ... you gain a new, insectoid arm.
1. ... you gain a new fractal finger. You can cast [Genoplasm](/2020/11/13/genoplasm/) at will with 1 SD per fractal finger.
1. ... one of your eyes split in twelve. You can use an action to frighten as many religions creatures as you have this mutation.
1. ... you grow a proposcis. You can use an action to drain fluids out of a fresh dead body and heal 1D4 HP. This completely dries the body. Increase the die size each time you get this mutation.
1. ... you lose a limb of your choice.
1. roll twice.
