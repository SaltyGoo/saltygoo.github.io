Brain-eating, thrall-making flying octopuses. A small aberration.

_Imagine a flying octopus, with a bulging, pulsing brain and two very human looking eyes._

_It seeks different able bodies to use as disposable labor to build their empire. Multiple digits are highly valuable._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** 1 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** slow, fly  and swim normal     |   | 

It **resists** mind attacks (because it's an aberration).
It **can** breathe underwater, see in the dark and speak telepathically, but only knows its own language and the ones known by the body it is controlling. 
It **can't** die unless it's would-be killer saves vs fear.
**However**, due to its partial understanding of personality, its face always reveals its true intentions.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Drill Brain.</ins> The brain-bat attaches itself to an adjacent target. If the target fails a saving throw, it takes willpower damage (1D4). At 0 intelligence, the target becomes a zombie enslaved to the attached brain-bat, who also gains its knowledge. An attached creature takes half the damage the brain-bat takes.

The brain-bat can take control of dead bodies in the same way.

The brain-bats is a monster that [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) adapted in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) from a 50s comic book, "The brain-bats from Venus". It's camp, it's scary and fun to play with. — SaltyGoo
