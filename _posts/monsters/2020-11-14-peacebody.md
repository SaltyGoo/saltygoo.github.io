##### From Garamondia’s [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/01/some-underworld-creatures.html)

**Humanoid-like cave grazers.** They eat and then bury themselves under piles of stones, or block up the entrance to natural caves, and wait to get hungry again. They are quite strong, but never defend themselves. Preyed on by almost everything in the underdark, and occasionally domesticated and used as beasts of burden. Each peacebody herd has one soldier. A medium herbivore beast. 

_Imagine pale, mindless creatures with roughly human bodies (although they move on all fours and are slightly larger), large cow-ish eyes, and weird internal organs._

It **can** see in the dark and has an acute sense of hearing. It is very good at moving rocks.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Panicked Push</ins>. The peacebody makes a melee attack (no damage) and the target is knocked prone.

<ins>Rocky Shelter</ins>. The peacebody starts building a nest of loose rocks, increasing its armor by 2 until it moves. Once it uses this abily three times in the same spot, it creates a small cave in and the peacebody is completely sheltered.

## Peacebody Soldier

They grow large, hideously strong, extremely violent, and attach themselves to peacebody herds as protectors.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Peacebodies are edible, but so humanoid-like that it turns off most surface dwellers.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
