Swarming acid-spitting blood-drinking beetles that live in colonies. Each form of vyderac has a specific role, with *Seekers* being usualy encountered first. A beast.

Imagine a grapefruit-sized scarab with a deep red shell and strong, oversized hind legs.

**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderacs do not see well but can smell vyderac pheromones up to a mile away. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 10’ without momentum. 

**Attacks (1/round)**

# Vyderac Swarm

**HD:** 0 +4D4HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as leather <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** dumb, wild <br>
**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderacs do not see well but can smell vyderac pheromones up to a mile away. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 10’ without momentum.

In a swarm, Vyderacs are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

When there are Vyderac Swarms, there's a Vyderac Feeder 1D4 rounds away.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Swarm.</ins> The Vyderac swarm makes a melee attack with reach using its HP as its attack stat (1D4). The damage inflicted is the number of Vyderacs attached to the victim (see above), the swarm loses as much HP.

# Vyderac Seeker

Imagine a cat-sized deep red scarab with atrophied elytra and protruding, oversized abdomen and eyes. It zips quickly and loudly across the sky.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** small <br>
**Stats:** agile, but weak otherwise <br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Vyderac Seekers detect heat, and are attracted to mammal body temperature.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Pheromone Spray.</ins> The Vyderac sprays a cone of fine yellow powder on one or two adjacent targets. If they fail to dodge, they are covered in Vyderac pheromones which cause urticaria. 1D4 Vyderac swarms will arrive in 1D6 hours.

<span class="alchemy"> **Vyderac Pheromones**. Contact poison. So itchy a sprayed target must save each round until they succeed three times or are washed, during which time they cannot focus on any task that extends beyond 1 turn. If they fail three times, they have scratched themselves until they bled and the poison has entered their body. In 10 minutes, they will be completely paralyzed until they are cured.</span>

**Movement:** slow<br>
**Morale:** mindless <br>

Vyderac Maggots are immune to acid, detect heat, and are attracted to mammal body temperature.

# Vyderac Queen

Imagine a humongus scarab with a bloated abdoment anchored to a tree with pulsing red vains. It's heavily armored with chitinous plates except in the bulging egg sacks that dangle from it. Every unprotected bit of her body is writhing with big maggots.

**HD:** 6HP  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as plate <br>
**Size:** huge <br>
**Stats:** strong, static, sturdy, and primal <br>
**Movement:** static<br>
**Morale:** reckless <br>

The Vyderac Queen is immune to acid. At the beginning of each combat round, a swarm of Vyderac Maggots crawls out of its abdomen-nest. This abdomen-nest is not as armored as the rest of the Queen, but, for each point of damage it takes, a maggot comes out.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Acidic Bile (Recharge 1/4).</ins> The Vyderac Queen cover a large area with acidic bile, inflicting damage (3D6) to each creature and object in range. A saving throw halves the damage, and sacrificing an item does the same. This attack releases a huge quantity of Vyderac Pheromones, and attracks 1D4 Vyderac Swarms which will arrive in 1D4 rounds.

<ins>Selfdestruction.</ins> The Vyderac Queen bloats herself in a grotesque way, releasing an acrid, acidic smell. On her next turn, she'll explode and die, inflicting 4D6 damage to all creatures in a large area. A saving throw halves the damage. One of the surviving maggots will become a new queen in a month.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

The elitrae of the Vyderac can be used to make a beautiful blood-red dye. The pheromone powder sack of a seeker can be used to attract swarms at your own risk. It also is a powerfull skin irritant. If you are lucky, the acid sacks of Vyderacs, Maggots and Queens can be salvaged into doses of acid.</details>

Vyderacs are a creation of [Jacob Hurst, Evan Peterson, and Donnie Garcia](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/) found in [Hot Springs Island](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/the-dark-of-hot-springs-island/). The creatures are not statted in the book, so I made my own version. — SaltyGoo
