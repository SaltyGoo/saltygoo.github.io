<ins>Perk</ins><br>
Instead of each SD, you have a piece of clothing made of foam (a winor water elemental in fact). Each these vestments decrease the damage you take from spells and other magical effects by 1.

When you expend a SD, that vestment disappears and you lose its effect. You only recover it if you spend a full rest submerged in water.

You can lend these vestments to other people, effectively giving them 1 SD and one of your spells. However, as long as they hold the clothes, you are [Charmed](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) by them.

<ins>Drawback</ins><br>
You are allergic to Iron. Contact with it prevents you from casting spells, while wounds by it make you [Poisoned](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until they are healed.

<ins>Cantrips</ins>
- You and creatures charmed by you can breathe underwater.
- As long as you sing them, your words can be understood by all mortals.
- If you have no water vestments left, you can take 10 minutes to meld into water and become invisible while submerged.
