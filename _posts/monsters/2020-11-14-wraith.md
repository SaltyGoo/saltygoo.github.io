*Ghostly spirit of barred from afterlife because of their corruption. Undead.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Originally named the bestial beast by its creator [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium), the bestial terror is basically a spectral centaur. On top of the spectral trample, I added typical centaur attacks: it was really important for me that the specters were able to drag mortals to the underworld with their pikes. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine black, jawless skull. From it, heavy, eery fog pours out. Ornate discolored torn robes and scarves dangle from it like inhabited by an invisible body. A cruel, silverd dagger peaks from a sleave, clenched by bony fingers.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** medium &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 4 / 8 / 8 / 6 / 7 / 7  <br>
**Immunities:** acid, blunt, cold, fatigue, grapple, petrification, pierce, poison, slash, sleep<br>
**Resistances:** all damage except magic <br>
**Armor:** none <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** fast (hover) &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** reckless <br>

**Spellcasting:** 50% of wraiths were spellcasters in life and can be expected to know 1D4 random spells.

The wraith sees in the dark. If it is hit by sunlight, it loses all damage resistances and immunities. As a gaseous creature, it can fit into any hole.

**Attacks:** Each round, the wraith can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Cursed Silver Dagger</ins>. The wraith makes a melee attack (x). On a hit, the creature is cursed.

<ins>Drain Life</ins>. A nearby wounded creature must make a save or take damage (x) and lose 2 point of Constitution. For a brief moments, it sees through the veil to the underworld.

<ins>Unsettle the Dead</ins>. A specter rises from a nearby dead body and serves the wraith.

1. Train an apprentice in the dark arts, so it can achieve what it couldnt in life.

## Summoning a Wraith

If you know the spell [Occult Consultation](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/13/occult-consultation/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 4 Spell Dices:

**Summon Wraith** <br>
R: Touch D: Sigil

When you cast this spell, you must name an humanoid who died evil and corrupted and claimed some sort of power during its lifetime. It appears before you in a cloud of drak smoke, hostile and ready to kill you, but will submit if you own a [great treasure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#treasures) that belonged to it in its life. If you were ever to lose the treasure, the wraith would disapear and dragon you to the underworld with it.
