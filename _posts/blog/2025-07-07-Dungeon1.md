title: Dungeon Generator Experiment #1
---


Since my **[dungeon generator](/pages/randomdungeon2/)** _beta_ now has 50 monsters to pick from, I wanted to earnestly try to use it and flesh out the results into something more coherent. For this dungeon, I settled on trying something that would fit in a highland plateau. With that in mind, I set the generator's biomes to _Plains_ and _Mountain_.

Here's the result that I got from the generator:
