**R**: 30â€™        **D**: [dice] hours

You conjure [dice] hovering sickly radiant lights that do not shed heat, do not require air, and are not doused by water. The illumination of each is similar to a torchlight.

Each gleam may be directed to bedevil an enemy, which will cause temporary [blindness](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) if a saving throw is failed as long as the gleam remains engaged.
