**R**: sight    **D**: [dice x 2] rounds

You bind your soul to a named sworn enemy. For the duration of the spell, damage caused by your sworn enemy cannot bring you below 1 Hit Point. In return, only you can kill your sworn enemy.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and inscribe your [sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the spell lasts until your sigil is broken.
