title: Elemental, Water

Sentient water. A water elemental.

_Imagine water moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in gargles and swirls._

_Calm until it's not, relativist, curious._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** X | **Armor:** as leather  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** normal, swim fast    |   | 

It is **immune** being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it's liquid). 
It **resists** all damage (because it's an elemental).
It **can** shape water at will, and move through any small hole.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round spent submerged.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent out of water. In general, it has the same properties as water.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Slam</ins>. The elemental makes a melee attack (XD4 damage).

<ins>Drown</ins>. The elemental makes a grapple attempt. On success, it pours itself into the target’s mouth, inflicting 1D4 constitution damage. As long as it is grappled, the target [can't breathe](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or talk.

<ins>Create Water</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates the equivalent of a 5' cube of water.
