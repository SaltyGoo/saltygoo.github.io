*Lumbering lizard with a petrifying gaze. Beast*

<span class="alchemy"> *A DnD classic that is suprisingly boring to fight compared to the expectations. Skerples from Coins & Scrolls made an amazing version in [the Tomb of the Serpent Kings](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-tomb-of-serpent-kings-megapost.html), which is incidently what inspired me to do this whole project. — SaltyGoo* </span>

A large eight legged lizard with a spine of quills and a square pupil. Basilisks are not aware of their power and eat whatever they petrify.

**HD:** 6  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** large &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 8 / 4 / 7 / 1 / 4 / 3  <br>
**Armor:** as chain <br>
**Damage:** 1D6 <br>
**Movement:** slow &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** brave <br>

The basilisk cannot see very well but its smell is very powerful, allowing it to see close creatures in the dark.

**Petrifying Gaze:** If the basilisk focuses on a creature for one round, the target’s limbs become heavy, slow, and gray. They can save vs. petrification to restore movement. If they fail, they are grappled. This effect ends immediately if the basilisk looks away. If the basilisk stares at a target for a second round, they must save again or be petrified. If they pass, they are still rooted in place (as above). The effect has a short range. More than one target can be affected, but they must be very close together.

**Attacks:** Each round, the basilisk can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Bite</ins>. The basilisk makes a melee attack (x). A grappled target takes extra poison damage (x) on a hit, a petrified one, (2x).

<ins>Frantic Charge</ins>. The basilisk runs in a straight line and makes an attack (x) against one target. A surprised target must save vs fear. 

<ins>Tail Swipe</ins>. While focusing on another creature, the basilisk smashes a creature behind it with its tail (x).

<ins>Trash</ins>. Each adjacent creatures must dodge or take damage (x) and be knocked prone.

## Salvaging the Body

Basilisk meat is toxic, but its leather is sturdy, its venom is deadly, but its eyes are the real prize: one can walk through a basilisk’s eye straight to the plane of earth.

A basilisk can be trained from birth to be a mount.

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Eye**. Tiny, closed portal to the elemental plane of earth.</span>

<span class="alchemy">**Basilisk Venom.** Save or be poisoned, save again each day to cure. Fail 4 saves and die. Drips through stone and cures petrification.</span>
