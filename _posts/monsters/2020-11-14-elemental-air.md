Sentient wind. An air elemental.

_Imagine wind moving and shaping itself as if it had its own will. Communicates in hisses and temperature changes._

_Fickle, emotional, LOUD and quiet._

| -------- | --------|
| **HD:** X | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** normal  |
| **Move:** fly fast    |   | 

It is **immune** to electricity, mundane weapons, and being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it's gaseous). 
It **resists** all other damage (because it's an elemental).
It **can** shape air at will, and move through any small hole.
**Also**, it recovers 1D6 HP every round spent only flying.
**However**, it takes 1D6 damage each round spent not moving, and wind can damage it.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Gust</ins>. The elemental pushes an adjacent creature. If it fails a save, it is blown away nearby, falls [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions), and takes damage (XD4) on impact.

<ins>Vortex</ins>. The elemental sucks all surrounding objects in. If they fail a save, each adjacent creature has the first 1D4 objects of their inventory stolen.

<ins>Create Wind</ins> (X/day). The elemental creates wind in a 20' cube which lasts X minutes. In that zone, moving is harder and missiles inflict half damage.
