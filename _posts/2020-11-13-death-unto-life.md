R: Touch

You bring back to life a corpse: a body missing parts will be brought to life missing those parts, miraculously alive should they miss vital organs. The departed is brought back to life at 1 HP, level zero and bedridden until they rest the the same amount of time they spent beyond the veil. Thereafter will recover 1 level per week, up to [dice] level. Should they accrue experience during recovery, it does not apply until the recovery is complete. 

After casting this spell you are profoundly enervated and must roll a D4. If you roll higher than [dice], you fall in a coma for a session. If you roll a 4, you provoke a [catastrophe](/class/magic-user#spells).
