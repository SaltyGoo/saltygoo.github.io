*Arachnomorphosis*

**R**: 60'

Fills the space between 1+[dice] points within range with thick sticky webbing, entangling any creature caught within it, or who tries to pass through the space. Spiders and the caster may freely climb on and pass through the webbed space, and big creatures can break through with a small amount of effort. It is highly flammable.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, you can see everything that touches the web, even if you are elsewhere.
