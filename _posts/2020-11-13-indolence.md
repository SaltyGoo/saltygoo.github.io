R: 60’ 		D: [dice] rounds

All within a melee area are stricken with lethargy, moving at half their normal rate, and acting last in initiative automatically. Creatures of [dice] HD or less are affected automatically, while others are permitted a saving throw to avoid the effect. 

Indolence may also be cast on mechanisms or other things that engage in progress or change.
