title: Curse of the [Animal]
---
**D**: [dice] hours

_All iterations of [animal] should be replaced by a specific animal species when the spell is first found._

A target creature that you have personally drawn the blood of is cursed with relentless assaults from [animal]. Over the course of the spell, [animal] will pounce from any nearby shadow upon the target. Any time the [animal] is killed, another will immediately spawn. Every hour an additional [animal] will spawn. The target may avoid this by being in a space with absolutely no shadow. After the time is up, the [animal] all vanish. The [animal] disperse into shadow-stuff when killed, leaving no remains.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
