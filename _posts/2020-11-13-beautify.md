R: Touch		D: [sum] hours

You make target creature or object more beautiful. Dirt falls away, pimples disappears, teeth whiten, lice vanish, gouges fill in, and varnish looks new again. Will also restore charisma to former max if damaged. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent.
