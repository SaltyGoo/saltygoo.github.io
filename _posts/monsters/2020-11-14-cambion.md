**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** strong, sturdy, intelligent and charismatic <br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast <br>

As a celestial being, the cambion resists everything and is immune to curses. Additionnally, the cambion is talented in all social and roguish skills and can see in the dark. Contrary to their divine parents, they can stay in the material world without issue. Most cambions own at least one magic item.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
In demonology, a cambion is the offspring of a woman and an incubus. DnD follows the theme and makes them equally proficient rogue, figther and thieves. This adaptation is based on the DnD 5th edition version, which I think managed to synthetise the bloated 2e one into a functional monster. â€” SaltyGoo
