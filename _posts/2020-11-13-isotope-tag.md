R: Touch  D: [dice] x 10 minutes

You tag a creature with radioactive isotopes, poisoning it for one round if it fails a save and allowing you to locate it baseed on radioactivity within 200â€™ for the duration of the spell. The creature cannot conceal itself from you as long as it is affected by the tag.

If 4 dices are invested in this spell, the effects are permanent.
