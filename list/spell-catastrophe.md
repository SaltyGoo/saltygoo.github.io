title: Curses and Catastrophes
---

Catastrophes most often happen when a spellcaster rolls too many pairs and triples on their [Spell Dice](/class/wizard#spells), but they are also designed to be used as curses by the referee when appropriate. It's a work in progress as I'm doing a list for each of the [Wonder & Wickedness](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145647/Wonder--Wickedness) and [Marvels & Malison](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/211911/Marvels--Malisons) spell schools that I use. Roll a smaller die than a D12 if you want to avoid the character-killing ones. The smaller the roll the kinder the consequence.

Reminder of the Salty Goo spell catastrophe rules: _Every time you roll doubles with your Spell Dice you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe._


## D12 Animorphic Catastrophes
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>1. Last Warning</b></summary>
You are losing your humanity. For the rest of this session and the next one, you cannot use any tools or say sentences longer than 1 word.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>2. Scientific Curiosity</b></summary>
You have become a mutant. Roll on the [mutation table](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html). You cannot rest in a town without attracting the attention of vivimancers intent on collecting your organs.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>3. Curse of Bats</b></summary>
Every time you cast a spell, 1D6 screaming bats fly out of your mouth. You are [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for as many turns as you belch them out.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>4. Chimera</b></summary>
You grow an extra [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator) head. It reacts to things as the wild animal would, with fear, hunger or curiosity, independently of you. You have to eat one extra ration per day.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>5. Permanent Transformation</b></summary>
You permanently transform into a [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator). You can still cast spells. If you were already transformed into an animal, this becomes permanent.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>6. Uncivilization</b></summary>
You are now uncomfortable around humans. You must save vs [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when you encounter one you do not know.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>7. Zoophobia</b></summary>
Every animal could be an animorph in disguise! You cannot cast spells in the presence of an animal. You must save vs [fear](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) when you witness a creature shapeshifting.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>8. Lycanthropy</b></summary>
The next time the sun sets, you will transform into a [random animal](https://www.generatormix.com/random-animal-generator) and try to bite as many people as possible before sunrise. Each bitten person will be affected by the same curse and transform into the same animal the next sunset. This has a 1/6 chance to happen every subsequent sunset. When you spend a night like this, you become [fatigued](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and do not recuperate your spell dice. Hunters are on their way to kill you.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>9. Unwelcomed Adaptation</b></summary>
Your nostrils are replaced by gills. You can breathe underwater but not outside of it.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>10. Wrong Layout</b></summary>
How is a body made again? Roll a D6: 1, left leg; 2, right leg; 3, left arm; 4, right arm; 5, chest; 6, head. Then roll again. The first limb is replaced by a new second limb. Reroll if they are the same.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>11. Oozification</b></summary>
You simply do not hold shape anymore. You have become an ooze. You have 3 inventory slots and can't talk.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>12. Abduction</b></summary>
The next time you go outside, a sickly light will pierce the sky and shine on you. You, and only you, will see the silhouettes of strange humanoids reaching out for you. The rest of the world will see you disappear. You will be found naked in a completely different location 1D4 years later with no memories.
</details>

## D12 Apotropaic Catastrophes
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>1. Last Warning</b></summary>
The next time you and your allies sleep in town, you are summoned by the Church for an endless inquiry on your careless use of magic.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>2. Confinement</b></summary>
All exits of the room you are in are sealed shut and locked. If you are not in a building, a single cell prison is build around you.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>3. Seal Magic</b></summary>
You've warded yourself from magic. Your Spell Dice are always expended when you use them.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>4. Safety Burden</b></summary>
For each spell in your Psyche, you must use another Psyche slot for the spell's "_proper instructions_". You cannot cast spells without them.
</details>
<details markdown="1">

Each movement in your vicinity, including yours, is signaled by an annoying alarm.
</details>
<details markdown="1">

<summary><b>7. Divine Manacles</b></summary>
Your hands are stuck together.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>8. Antimagic Beacon</b></summary>
The area around you is completely sealed from magic. No spells can affect you and you can't cast spells. Feys avoid you, divine agents hate you.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>9. Soultrapped</b></summary>
Choose an item in your inventory. You are trapped in it like a genie in a bottle. You can hear a bit, although all sounds are muffled, and, if you scream, people outside can hear you, but not much louder than a whisper. You do not need to eat while trapped this way.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>10. Undetection</b></summary>
You are barely perceptible: nobody cares to interact with you, and you cannot interact with anything of significance. You can speak, but it will not be remembered.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>11. Seal Crowd</b></summary>
Every player in your group must flip a coin. If it's head, their character is soultrapped (see number 9). The same happens with all npcs and monsters in the area.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>12. Doom the World</b></summary>
You break the wards protecting the integrity of the world. An eldritch god starts phasing in!
</details>

## D12 Diabolic Catastrophes
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>1. Last Warning</b></summary>
Your forehead is branded with heretical writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to be judged. Any agent of the Church or the Law will be compelled to prosecute you if they see it. Additionaly, if this writing is intoned by _any_ spellcaster or cleric, a [greater divine agent](/list/monsters-celestial) will be summoned.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>2. Devilish Pride</b></summary>
You and all allies nearby grow long, curving, goatlike horns. These are permanent, and mark those so affected as traffickers in diabolic magic. You cannot find respectable housing in towns. A mob will form if you are seen more than a day in the same settled location.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>3. Abyssal Poachers</b></summary>
You have been marked as a disturber of souls. Every time an intelligent life dies because of you, 1D4 of the [dretch demons](/monsters/dretch) tracking you are summoned to feast on it. This does not please the Authority.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>4. Intermediary Contractor</b></summary>
Anyone that makes a deal with you is unknowingly also making a deal with the devil who inherited you soul. If they do not discharge the debt, their souls are also inherited by it. Because of that, the devil will do everything short of direct intervention to prevent them from fulfilling their debt to you.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>5. Possession</b></summary>
The attention of a demon is attracted. It can now see whatever you see, and speak using your mouth, though the voice becomes different and ominous. Your eyes now glow a faint orange in darkness. It will try to cause the most violent chaos.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>6. Nightmare Manifested</b></summary>
One randomly determined person near the casting of the spell in your group is permanently marked with a demonic sigil. This sigil conjures a [lesser horror](/list/monsters-aberration) each time the afflicted person sleeps. Determine its reaction as normal.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>7. The Teint</b></summary>
You are permanently imbued with the nature of demons, and becomes subject to many demonic weaknesses. For example, holy water becomes damaging, circles of protection keep you out, and so forth. Furthermore, you lose the ability to cross running water without collapsing into unconsciousness. Crossing a line of salt, such as used with some magic circles, causes you 1D6 damage.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>8. An Eye for an Eye</b></summary>
An imp familiar is summoned. This familiar has your eyes, which cease to reside in your head. You continue to be able to see from the eyes, though do not control the imp directly. The imp may not travel more than 100 feet away from you. If it is slain, the eyes are banished to another place where swirling colors and running, pulsing veins are all that is visible.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>9. Revelation</b></summary>
The skies of far off places open above you. The vista seen contains geometries beyond the abilities of mortals to understand. All NPCs in the hex permanently become corrupted, most to the point of becoming murderers. You gain a new [Dabolist](/spells/#diabolism) spell and are now cosmically know as the antigod.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>10. Gluttony</b></summary>
You are bound to a demon of gluttony. In the future, prior to casting any spell, you must consume two full days of rations. You will never again feel satiated.
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>11. Eldritch Gateway</b></summary>
Every time you cast a spell in the future, there is a 1 in 6 chance of accidentally also summoning a [greater horror](/list/monsters-aberration), reaction determined as normal
</details>
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>12. Damnation</b></summary>
The next time you reach 0 HP, you are immediately dragged to hell to be judged.
