<summary><b>Arassas Bile</b></summary>
_Corrosive antifreeze used by [Cat-Dragons](/monsters/arassas) to carve their meandering tunnel-dens through glaciers.

<summary><b>Arctic Bat Venom</b></summary>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Basilisk Eye</b></summary>
_Sought after by wizards and masons alike, [Basilisk](/monsters/basilisk) Eyes must be kept hydrated and in the dark at all time and have no powers if harvested more than an hour after the beast's death._

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Leech Drool</b></summary>

<span class="alchemy">**Leech Drool**. Prevents scarring and pain from an open wound.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Luck Powder</b></summary>
_The jungle [fruit-fairies](/monsters/aziza) grow strange fruits in the shape of dead tresspassers. When these fruits are dried and grounded, they produce the drug colloquialy known as "Powdered Luck". Many adventurers grow apoplectic and terrorized of failure after relying too much on it._

<span class="alchemy">**Luck Powder.** For 10 minutes, you cannot roll below 10. For a session after your first snort, you must carry an aziza on your shoulder (taking an inventory slot). You get two azizas after your second snort, etc. You and fairies are the only ones who can see or hear them. They are chatty.</span>
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Iron Apple Seed</b></summary>
_Grown in the mist along leylines by the mysterious three-armed [athach giants](/monsters/athach) and jealously garded by them, Iron Apple Trees make for an exotic garden feature. Notably, the fruits produced can be smelted to forge [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) weapons tailor-made to kill fairies._

<span class="alchemy"> **Iron Apple Seed**. If planted in hard rock along a leyline and watered, it will grow into a tree producing [cold iron](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#rare-metals) apples.</span>

<summary><b>Vyderac Pheromones</b></summary>
_The deadly tropical [vyderac beetles](/monsters/beetle-vyderac) spray this fine yellow powder to attract their swarm to a potential pray. As deadly as it is irritating, the pheromones will lure 1D4 vyderac swarms in 1D6 hours if used in the jungle. This property is actually the most dangerous, as whole villages have been known to be have been consumed by the Swarm after a pheromone bomb was planted in it._

<span class="alchemy"> **Vyderac Pheromones**. Contact poison. So itchy, a sprayed target must save each round until they succeed three times or are washed, during which time they cannot focus on any task that extends beyond 1 turn. If they fail three times, they have scratched themselves until they bleed and the poison has entered their body. In 10 minutes, they will be completely [stunned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until they are cured.</span>

Vyderac pheromones are also found in liquid, acidic form when harvested from larvae and queens.

<summary><b>Willow Death</b></summary>
_One of the most potent, if simple, toxin is produced by the [olitiau clawed bat](/monsters/bat-olitiau). A single dose of this poison can be harvested from each of these deadly fluffy critters, but few dare disturbing their colonies._
