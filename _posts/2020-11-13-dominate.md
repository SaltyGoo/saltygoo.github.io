R: 30’ D: [dice] hours

By standing completely still with eyes closed in concentration, you may psychically enter the body of another, gaining access to any of their senses, and dictate the subject’s physical actions. A saving throw applies, but does not end the spell, and you may attempt command again in following rounds against the same subject or another. Subjects of this spell may resist any given dictated action by taking [dice] damage.
