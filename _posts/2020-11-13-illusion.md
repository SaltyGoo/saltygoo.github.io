**R**: Sight  **D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You create an illusion of whatever object or creature you want, up to the size of carriage. It can move at your will, but cannot make any sound or smell. Illusions can only add, not subtract. They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole.

If you invest 4 or more dice in this spell, the effect becomes permanent.
