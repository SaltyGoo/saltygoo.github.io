Bats are nocturnal flying mammals that nest in dark spaces. A tiny beast.

_Imagine flying mouse-like creatures with leathery arm-wings._

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of silver in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Bats are cute enough to be pets, but be careful of the [disease](/2024/01/01/bat-flu/) they carry.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
