You instantly summon [sum] [Purses of Gold Coins](/2024/06/26/currency/) from the Treasury of Hell. They stink of brimstone for a few minutes. You can fling loose coins as you summon them - people-sized and smaller creatures are likely to be startled or knocked off their footing, if they get hit with a flying cloud of a monthâ€™s wages. 

This increases the debt you owe to the Treasury by the amount you summoned. You gain 1 doom point for each 4 purses not repaid when you carouse.
