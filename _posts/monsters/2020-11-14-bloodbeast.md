Giant spider leech. A large beast.

_Imagine a sand-colored leech as long as a horse. It stands high on six long insectoid legs. Its head is framed by vestigial gills._

The bloodbeast and the bloodgill are original creations of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/11/new-oebx1e-monster-bloodgill_20.html) originally for his* Starmaster* sci-fi game. It's weird and I love the idea of being sucked dry by a swarm of bipedal tadpoles. — SaltyGoo
