title: Dingonek
---

Armored poisonous dinosaur with a deadly bite and a deadlier tail. A large beast.

_Imagine a large lumbering armadillo. It is covered in pangolin-like brown scales. Its head is topped by a two feet-long single horn and two long canines frame its snout like sabers. Its tail is lined on all sides by irregular spikes. Many pieces of vegetation are stuck on it._

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>

Killing a dingonek is very dangerous but it can feed a village and many weapons can be made from its hide: scale armor, clubs and spears, etc. but the most precious is without doubt its poison.

The dingonek is a cryptid from kenya described as a giant saber-toothed semi-aquatic armadillo. [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/)'s adaptation in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium) chooses to give it poison. I imagined it like some sort of hippo-ankylosaur. â€” SaltyGoo </details>
