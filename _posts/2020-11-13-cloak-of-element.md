title: Cloak of [Element]
---

**D**: [dice]*10 minutes

_All iterations of [element] should be replaced with a specific element rolled below when the spell is first found._

As you stand in presence of a significant amount of [element], you invite its spirit to take a ride on your back. For some, it looks like a cloak made of pure [element], for some others, it looks like a strange creature piggy-backing on you. For the duration of the spell, you are immune to [element], and choose [dice] of the following options:

- You are invisible in that element.
- Creatures adjacent to you take [dice] damage on your turn.
- You have [sum] temporary hit points.
- You leave a trail of the element. If either inflicts damage or is difficult to cross.

If the spell ends naturally, the elemental spirit will stay wherever you drop it and might change the area over the course of days.
