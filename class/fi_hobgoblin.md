<summary>Design Notes</summary>
*Hobgoblins have become so humanized in DnD that they are now indistinguishable from a normal human. I decided to push back a bit against that and play them as the leaders of infinitely multiplying minions. I couldn't find the credit of this image if anybody knows it. â€” SaltyGoo*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A Leather Armor, a Weapon of your choice, and choose one of a 10' Chain, two crappy goblin Shanks (1D4 damage), or a Stink Bomb

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Wolfrider, Legionnaire, Dumpyard Bully, or Goblin Herder

For every Hobgoblin template you have, you can gain one extra **Goblin Minion**.

**A:** Goblin Minions, Taller Goblin<br>
**B:** Gobleadership<br>
**C:** Bugbeardom<br>
**D:** Goblin Legion<br>

## Goblin Minions
You have a knack for finding goblins to serve you wherever you are. Each goblin you have can carry one object at a time, and weapons they use can't inflict more than 1D4 damage. They will obey your orders blindly but are completely unskilled except for stabbing. They have 1 HP.

You can have as many minions at a time as Hobgoblin templates you have and they dont count towards your follower limit. You can find _one_ new goblin when you wake up from a rest and replace one who died .

## Taller Goblin
You are still a goblin. You and your goblins can see in the dark as if you were carrying torches.

## Bad Leadership
You can sacrifice one of your adjacent goblins to reduce incoming damage by 1D4, or to make a humanoid save vs fear from you.

## Bugbeardom
When one of your goblins kills something, it becomes bigger and meaner. Its maximum damage increases by 1 dice size and it gains 3HP.

## Goblin Legion
You can now find up to 4 replacement goblins each time you rest. 

You can "roll" them as a [wizard](/class/wizard#spells) would do Spell Dice to help you on any task: Each goblin is a D4 that can be added to any of your rolls. If the result of the roll is 3 or 4, the goblin dies pathetically helping you. 

These goblins can even be used as actual Spell Dice if you find a spell book. If you do so, you take 1 damage for each die roll of 3 or 4 from the goblin exploding. The pell effects are reflavored as goblins acting it.
