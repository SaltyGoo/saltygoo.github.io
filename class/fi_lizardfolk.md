<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
*This is a monster class for the [lizardfolk](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/lizardfolk). I wanted to emule how I remember how the komodo dragon hunts: takes a bite, waits for the wound to fester or the prey to get exhausted, take another bite, repeat. â€” SaltyGoo*
