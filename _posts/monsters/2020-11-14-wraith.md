---

Ghostly spirit barred from the afterlife because of their corruption. An undead.

_Imagine black, jawless skull. From it, heavy, eerie fog pours out. Ornate discolored torn robes and scarves dangle from it like inhabited by an invisible body. A cruel, silver dagger peaks from a sleeve, clenched by bony fingers._

_Veteran figther, Hatred of the living, Villainous arrogance._

| **HD:** 4 | **Armor:** none  |
| **Hit it:** hard    | **Dodge it:** hard  |
| **Move:** fast    |   | 

It is **immune** to nonmagical damage, being [grappled](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) or [petrified](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it is ethereal), as well as [poison](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) and [exhaustion](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) (because it is undead). It doesn't need to eat, breathe, sleep.  
It **can** see in the dark, and be very good at any dark task master in its life. 
**However**, direct sunlight makes it lose all resistances and immunities.
Out of combat, it can cast forbidden curse **magic**.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Cursed Silver Dagger</ins>. The wraith makes a melee attack (1D6). On a hit, the creature is [cursed](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Drain Life</ins>. A nearby wounded creature must make a save or take damage (1D8) and lose 2 points of Fortitude. For a brief moment, it sees through the veil to the underworld.

<ins>Spellcasting</ins>. *Conjure Fog, One Random [Spell](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/spells)*

<ins>Unsettle the Dead</ins>. A specter rises from a nearby dead body and serves the wraith.

<summary>Summoning the Spirit</summary>

If you know the spell [Occult Consultation](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/13/occult-consultation/), you can alter it in such a way for a minimum of 4 Spell Dice:

**Summon Wraith** <br>
R: Touchâ€ƒD: Sigil

When you cast this spell, you must name a humanoid who died evil and corrupted and claimed some sort of power during its lifetime. It appears before you in a cloud of dark smoke, hostile and ready to kill you, but will submit if you own a [great treasure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#treasures) that belonged to it in its life. If you were ever to lose the treasure, the wraith would disappear and drag you to the underworld with it.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
DnD's [wraith](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/wraith.html) is not much more than a glorified specter, and does not translate much into the amazingness that are Tolkien's. I also really love the version (and illustration!) found in Michael Prescott's [Trilemma Adventure Bestiary](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/315827/Trilemma-Adventures-Bestiary-B-X). Now wraiths can wield cursed weapons and cast spells if you want.
