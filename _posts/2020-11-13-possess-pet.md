**R**: sight  **D**: [dice] * 10 minutes

Take complete control of an animal in your entourage. You can speak through it but not cast spells. Your real body becomes blind and limp.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent and you can cast spells in your new form.
