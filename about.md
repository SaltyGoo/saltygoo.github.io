u/SaltyGoo's quarantine project to compile all his GLoG ressources and monsters. For my players and whoever wants.

### More Information

My impossible plan : I compiled a list of 9K monsters from the history of DnD and I'm going through them randomly making them GLoG friendly and generate a crazy hex generator from them. Oh and learn GitHub.

### Contact me

u/SaltyGoo on reddit? is that enough?
