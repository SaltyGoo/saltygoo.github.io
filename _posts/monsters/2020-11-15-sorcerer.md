**People imbued with raw magical enery.** Sorcerers are innate spellcasters who can unleash powerful spells upon which they have little control. Sorcerers are often seen with _[Elementals](/list/monsters-elemental)_.

Out of combat, the sorcerer can cast elemental magic.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Dagger</ins>. The sorcerer makes a melee attack (1D6).

<ins>Energy Overflow</ins>. The sorcerer becomes engulfed in magical energy and starts floating 10 feet higher. As long as it is not touching the ground, damage points makes it drop by as many feet instead of hurting it.

<ins>Energy Blast</ins> (while in energy overflow only). The sorcerer flies 10 feet higher, and, for each consecutive times it has used this ability, shoots raw energy at a target in sight (1D6) and takes half the damage inflicted.

## **Sorcerer Variants**

Add the following powers to the generic sorcerer for a twist.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Fire Trickster</b>. A pyromancer.</summary>
**Resists** fire, and **can** enter flames as if they were a door and come out of another flame it can see.

<ins>Fire Energy Blast.</ins> Like Energy blast, but one flammable object on the target catches on fire on a hit.

<ins>Flame Twin.</ins> The sorcerer transforms a fire nearby into a copy of itself with 1 HP. This copy dissipates after 1 round without fuel.
