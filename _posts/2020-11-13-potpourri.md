title: Potpourri

**R**: Touch		**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You touch a diseased thing and trap the malady in a previously sigiled potpourri, curing it. As long as you breathe the potpourri's aroma —through a plague-doctor mask for example— you are immune to this specific disease. 

You can also breathe it on adjacent things to contaminate them before the spell depletes after [dice] times. A save is allowed to resist.
