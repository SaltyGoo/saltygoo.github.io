*Heron-crocodile dinosaur. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *Aqraseths are a creation of Richard J. Leblanc Jr found in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I matched its abilities with those of a DnD crocodile and made a giant version, because it looks like a semi-plausible dinosaur species already. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a big crane-like bird with a crocodilian head. The aqraseth is a diurnal ambush predator.
