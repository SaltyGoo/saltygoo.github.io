There’s not much to gain there besides a bit of fur and feather, but cubs would be extremely valuable.

The giant tressym doesn't exist in DnD under that name, but is found as the Jana-nimr, or Greater Winged Cat, in the [Al-Qadim Bestiary](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/catwinge.html). Interestingly, they speak! I gave them two separate monster pages because one is a pet, and the other is a puma. — SaltyGoo
