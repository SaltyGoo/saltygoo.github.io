title: Length of a String
---

R: Touch		

For a round, you can extend or reduce a rope up to 100’ per [dice]. It’s not stretched nor elastic, the spell simply makes the rope longer (and shorter) as needed, and only when wanted. If still elongated at the end of the spell, the rope unravels into long, impossibly narrow and very weak fibers.
