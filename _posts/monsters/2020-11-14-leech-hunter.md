title: Leech, Hunting
---

##### From Garamondia’s [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-optical-dungeonthe-process-dungeon.html)

**Pack-hunting fast leeches.** Leech-things about as long as a forearm, with sharp, rigid mouth-parts. Surprisingly quick. Sometimes domesticated as something like a hunting hound; the smell of blood drives them into a frenzy. A tiny beast.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of silver in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Hunter leeches dont produce natural painkillers like their cousins, but are much easier to tame. They are edible.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
