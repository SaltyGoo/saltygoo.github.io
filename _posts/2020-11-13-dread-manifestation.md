You call forth the deepest monstrous fear from a mind nearby.

When the spell expires, the manifestation:

1. Leaves behind some inanimate material remains.
1. Attains full materiality and autonomy.
1. Turns on you for [dice]*10 minutes. Roll again after the durtion.
1. Vanishes in a pillar of fire.
1. Haunts the area permanently as a dim psychic echo which may spontaneously erupt as per this spell description.
1. Persists and is actually a fear doppelganger which will take on a new shape based on the fears or nightmares of other nearby minds.
