title: Witchmark
---
**D**: [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon)

You place the witchmark on a threshold or a spherical object, vexing all casters, then completes it with your own Sigil to be immune from its effects. The mark makes the threshold both impervious and unpassable to other casters of level [dice] or less, while the sphere will be coveted by other nearby casters of the same level that happens to give it a mere glance. Victims can try to avoid the threshold effect by saving once, but must save every round to escape the sphere enthrallment.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, all casters will be affected.
