---

Fluffy white bats with freezing venom. A beast.

Arctic bats are white and fluffy, which gives them excellent camouflage in snow. They are carnivores.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** tiny <br>
**Stats:** agile and alert but weak and feral<br>
**Movement:** slow, fly fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Bats have a very keen hearing, allowing them to easily spot their preys and predators in the dark: as long as they can hear, they can detect invisible creatures. Additionally, Arctic Bats resist cold and look like snowflakes, making them hard to hit during snowstorms.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Bite</ins>. The arctic bat makes a melee attack. On a hit, the target must save vs poison or slowly freeze and be restrained. The target can save again at the end of its next turn to cure the effect. On a second failure, the target is frozen for 24h. This effect only happens in subzero temperatures.

<summary>Salvaging the body</summary>
Arctic bat fur is very fluffy, but a huge amount of bats must be skinned to make a coat, making it very expensive. Arctic bat venom is valued as a food preserver.

Arctic bat seem to be an original creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/) in the [Creature Compendium](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/147588/CC1-Creature-Compendium). I loved the idea of the freezing venom. â€” SaltyGoo
