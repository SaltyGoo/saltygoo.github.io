##### From Garamondia's [Optical Dungeon](https://garamondia.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-optical-dungeonthe-process-dungeon.html)

**Invisible portal pests.** Dimensional vermins hide and cower in any places where there are frequent interdimensional travels. They will harass and ambush isolated targets. Sometimes seen sharing their habitat with [chokers](/monsters/choker). A small horror.

_It is silent and invisible. But if you could see it, imagine a small crouching red humanoid with bug eyes, long claws and a toothy vertical mouth._

It is **invisible**. When "killed", it briefly becomes visible and the person who made the last blow must save vs fear. On a failure, the vermin simply runs away at 1 HP.

**Attacks (1/round, twice if it loses its invisibility)**

<ins>Cowardly Claws</ins>. The vermin makes a melee attack (1D4, 1D6 if the target is surprised) and runs away nearby.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Study It (1D6 Mutations)</summary>
If you have disected or conversed with this horror, you can spend the equivalent of 1 bag of gold to feverishly study the thing between two adventures and discover weird knowledge beyond reality. If you do so, your studies of the aberration will change you in horrible, gruesome ways : Roll 1D6 for each gold cost spent this way. One of your body parts become invisible :

1. ... one of your legs.
1. ... one of your arms.
1. ... your skin everywhere.
1. ... your chest.
1. ... your face.
1. roll twice.

This invisibility only affects the body part, not equipment. Mutations take an inventory slot and cannot be removed.
