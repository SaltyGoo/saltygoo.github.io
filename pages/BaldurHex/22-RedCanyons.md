<button id="generateText" >Generate Encounter</button> <br>

<span class="grey" id="result" style="height: 75px;"> Click the button above to generate an encounter. </span>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Encounter Rules</summary>
Generate an encounter the first time the party goes to one of this hex's features and every 12 hours. Encounters can happen on the way to the location or at the destination. If an encounter would happen while the party rests, good survival skills while setting up camp make the encounter happen after the full rest is completed. Search the [Baldur's Gate Wiki](https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_Wiki) for informations on named NPC. Do not hesitate to replace any named NPC by one the players have already met from time to time! It makes for a better story.

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature B - Corrupted Standing Stones</span>

This meeting point for druids at the conflux of ancient leylines has been corrupted by Bassilus the murderer. Doing a specific ritual here allows communication through the other standing stones of the Southern Sword Coast, and some even say teleportation. The other standing stones that can be activated are in:

<span class="blacktitle"> Feature C - Sorlyn Shrine</span>

The sorlyn priest Velmos Sonder has the peculiar power to make stones sing. He plans to build an abbey dedicated to god Milil here once the corruption is gone. The land has been granted to him by the Tharthyn merchant family of Amn.
