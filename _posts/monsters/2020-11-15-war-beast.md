<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some large or bigger [beasts](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-beast) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Underlined abilities are added to the attack options of the original creature. For damage, replace X with the creature's basic attack damage. â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

Humanoids have found many ways to use hulking beasts for war. War beasts have powers that support smaller, weaker creatures in combat situations like sieges.<br>
