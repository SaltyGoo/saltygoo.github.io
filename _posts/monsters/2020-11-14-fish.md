Fish can breathe underwater but not outside of water. They have big eyes that allow them to see in the dark.

In schools, fish are immune to being grappled or attacked by single target spells, and resist mind and weapon damage. However, they take double damage from area of effect attacks.

**Attacks (1/round)**
