D: 10 minutes

Anything within 10*[dice] feet of you may be shifted entirely into the spirit world, thus becoming invisible, insubstantial, and ethereal (unwilling conscious targets are permitted a saving throw). 

You must remain within the boundaries of the enchantment, and nothing may leave for the duration of the spell (though you may permit other entities entrance by whim). 

Paradoxically, the gaping absence does not affect the material world in any other way (for example, bridges will continue to stand if their supports are shifted).
