title: Beetle, Giant Flayer

*Brain sucking giant flea. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The giant flayer beetle is an orginal creation of [Richard J. Leblanc Jr](http://savevsdragon.blogspot.com/2012/08/new-oebx1e-monster-giant-flayer-beetle.html). When adapting it to the GLoG, I made it slightly less sturdy but a bit more reliable: the original was only threatening when rolling a critical hit, this one does intelligence damage more often. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a cat-sized flea with a green iridescent exoskeleton. A long probe coils from its mouth.

**HD:** 0  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** small &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 3 / 6 / 6 / 1 / 3 / 1 <br>
**Armor:** as leather <br>
**Damage:** 1D2 <br>
**Movement:** slow &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** coward <br>

Giant flayers do not see well but can detect movement nearby. They can easily walk on any surfaces, even upside down and can jump 20’ without momentum.

**Attacks:** Each round, the giant flayer can perform one of these actions:

<ins>Attach.</ins> The giant flayer jumps on a target’s head. Unless the target succesfuly dodges the beetle is attached to it.

<ins>Probe.</ins> The giant flayer inflicts both physical and intelligence damage (x) to a target it is attached to as it starts extracting its brain.

## Salvaging the Body

Giant flayer shell can be used for armor but has 1-6 chance to break on each hit. A more common use would be to ground it to make a green iridescent dye.
