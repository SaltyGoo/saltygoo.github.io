title: Bird, Boltforager
---

##### A monster originating from the [Hot Springs Island](https://shop.swordfishislands.com/the-dark-of-hot-springs-island/) adventure.

**A disease-carrying violent carrion bird.** The discordant chorus of huge boltforager flocks is a staple of many hot climates. They harass other creatures indiscriminately at dusk and dawn, when their orange plumage blends in the golden light. They feed on those who fall victim of the parasites they carry.  A small scavenging beast.

_Imagine a big eagle-sized bird with brick-colored plumage. It has a big beak and a bony ridge that protects its head when feeding. It seems covered in dirty orange dust._

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 1 [bag of gold](/2024/06/26/currency/) in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence.

<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
The boltforager's beak and bony ridge make a solid, easy to carve material. The dust covering it is full of worm eggs and can be of interest to those interested in biological warfare. Its meat is edible, but must be thoroughly cleansed of the parasites.

If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
