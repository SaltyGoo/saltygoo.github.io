**R**: 90â€™     **D**: [sum] rounds

If it fails a save, target creature or object splits into [1+dice] copies, with divided hit points (or capacity). 

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and inscribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent. If you roll a triple on you spell dice, you trigger a nuclear explosion.
