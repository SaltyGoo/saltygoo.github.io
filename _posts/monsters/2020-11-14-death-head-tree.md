title: Death's Head Tree
---

*Parasitic tree with face shaped fruits. Beast.*

<span class="alchemy"> *The original [death's head tree](http://adnd.geoshitties.installgentoo.com/mm/deaheatr.html) comes from Ravenloft, and like many Ravenloft creatures, it is full of creepy flavour. For this adaptation, I simply streamlined the mechanics. — SaltyGoo* </span>

Imagine a weeping willow but with much thicker branches. It bears head sized fruits that smell like rotting flesh and sporadically have gas leaks that sound like cries. Even more disturbingly, from afar, each fruit looks like the severed head of a humanoid and floats if detached.

**HD:** 6  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Size:** huge &nbsp; &nbsp; **Stats:** 9 / 0 / 9 / 1 / 3 / 3 <br>
**Immunities:** blindness, charm, daze, deafness, mind <br>
**Resistances:** bludgeoning, piercing, fire <br>
**Armor:** as plate <br>
**Damage:** 1 <br>
**Movement:** none &nbsp; &nbsp; **Morale:** mindless <br>

The death’s head tree is a plant: it has no sight or earing but detects movement.

**Multiple heads:** The death’s head tree has 4D4 heads. While it has more than one head, it has advantage on saving throws. Whenever the death’s head tree takes 4 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads detaches.

**Attacks:** Each round, the death’s head tree can perform as many of these actions as it has heads:

<ins>Kiss.</ins> The death’s head tree makes one melee attack (x). On a hit, the target makes a save vs poison or catches the death’s head parasite.

<ins>Needle.</ins> The death’s head tree makes one ranged attack. On a hit, the target makes a save vs poison or catches the death’s head parasite.

<span class="alchemy"> **Death's Head Parasite.** Disease. Symptom: reduces maximum HP by 1D4. Save every night to avoid adding a cumulative symptom. If max HP is 0, gain 1D4 wounds instead.<span>

# Death's Head Fruit

Imagine very rotten squash whit folds that make it look like a pretty convincing wrinkly face. It floats.

## Salvaging the Body

Death’s head fruits are not only disgusting, but also diseased. The wood from the tree is supple and dark red, a favorite of vampire artisans. Magic weapons and armors can often be found under the roots of such tree.
