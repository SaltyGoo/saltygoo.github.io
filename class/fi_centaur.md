<span class="alchemy"> *This was initially a monster class for the [Centaur](https://saltygoo.github.io/monsters/centaur) but seems like it could be used for an actual horse. Its a good fighting class, and it becomes very absurd if you multiclass into a specialist (wall-climbing horse-person!). â€” SaltyGoo* </span>

For every Centaur template you have, increase your HP and Movement by 1.

**A:** Half-Horse, Hooves I<br>
**B:** Ride or Die, Star Map<br>
**C:** Charge<br>
**D:** Hooves II<br>

## Half-Horse
- You have as many extra inventory slots as your Strength. A rider takes 5 inventory slots. 
- You do not add your movement score to climbing crawling, swimming rolls.
- You do not fit in crawl spaces.

## Hooves I
You can attack with your hooves, inflicting 1D6 damage and allowing you to attempt to shove.

## Ride or Die
You and your rider can take a hit for one another. You also take your turn at the same time, using the best initiative.

## Star Map
You and your team can travel twice as fast through arctic, desert and plains hexes. Once per travel day, you can choose to not roll for encounter in these hexes.

## Charge
If you use all your movement running towards a creature, you and your rider's next melee attack against it this turn inflict an extra 1D6 damage and you can use your Movement score instead of your strength for your attack roll.

## Hooves II
You can make your Hooves attack on top of another attack each round.
