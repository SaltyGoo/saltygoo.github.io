<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
Inspired by my templateless [Priest](/class/priest) class. I thought that my previous GLOG wizard amalgam had too many features for my players. This one aims to focus on one thing at a time: spellbooks. It also allows the referee to add easily spellbooks to dungeons in a way that is flavourful and mechanically coherent. Most of all, it is my homage to the thing that drew me to the GLOG to begin with: its litteral hundreds of wizards! Most of the spellbooks described bellow are direct conversions from my favourites among them.

So how is this wizard different from the aforementioned priest? It sure does look identical! Well no. First, the wizard gains spell dices every level and can do whatever it wants with them, the priest gains spell dices each time it matches a certain condition and can only cast each of its spells once per day. Second, the priest chooses a new sacrament every level, a wizard is stuck with its starting spellbook unless it finds new ones in its advantures. The wizard can also spend Treasures to study more spells even when they are not leveling up. In the end, the priest will have fewer spells, but a potentially unlimied amount of spell dices, while the wizard will have 4 spell dices and a potentially unlimited amount of spells. Multiclassing as a Priest and a Wizard is heretical. </details>

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A strange hat, ink and quill, a spellbook (see below)

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of "University Graduate", "Alchemist", "Charlatan" or "Forbidden Knowledge"

For every Wizard template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and you **Study**.

## Spells
Wizards get a [random one](/list/spells) for free at level 1. They’re stored in spellbooks and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.
<details markdown="1">
<summary>How GLOG spells work</summary> 
<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Wizard template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.
</details>

## Study
You need a Spell book to study. You cannot take a Magic User template if you do not possess a spell book. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again. You can spend a Treasure when you end a session in town to study again.
