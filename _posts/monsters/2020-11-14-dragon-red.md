Fire-breathing mountain dragon. A huge beast.

_Imagine a strong looking dragon, with crimson scales, yellow belly and fearsome horns. It loves to display its superiority in everything._

_Titanic strength, arrogant intelligence, overconfident charisma._

## Red Dragon Lair

Non-wyrmlings dragons have the following additional attack options when in their lair (using the same dice as their rake/stomp attack):

<ins>Lava Eruption:</ins> The earth cracks at one point the dragon can see, creating a 20’ high, 10’ wide geyser of magma. Creatures in the area must dodge or take fire damage (2Dx).

<ins>Earthquake:</ins> Each creature on the ground within sight of the dragon must make a save or be knocked [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Volcanic Fissures:</ins> A fissure opens between two points and bursts with toxic volcanic gas. Creatures over the vent must save or be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until the end of their next turn. The vents have 1/4 chance to be exhausted each turn.
