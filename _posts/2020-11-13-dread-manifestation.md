---
**R**: 60’ 		**D**: [dice] rounds

You call forth the deepest monstrous fear from a mind nearby. This manifestation is only real to the source of the fear (it has [sum] HP, and inflicts 1D6 damage, if any), though it is merely a dim phantom to all other observers. When the spell expires, roll a D6. The manifestation:

1. Leaves behind some inanimate material remains.
1. Attains full materiality and autonomy.
1. Turns on you for [dice]*10 minutes. Roll again after the durtion.
1. Vanishes in a pillar of fire inflicting [sum] damage.
1. Haunts the area permanently as a dim psychic echo which may spontaneously erupt as per this spell description.
1. Persists and is actually a fear doppelganger which will take on a new shape based on the fears or nightmares of other nearby minds.
