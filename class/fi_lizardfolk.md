## Aquatic
You can [hold your breath](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) 20 minutes. When you take damage while holding your breath, you dont risk drowning.

## Sickening Bite
You have a bite attack (1D6). A creature bitten by you will be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) the following day from the infection unless it receives medical treatments.

## Slow Metabolism
You only [save for disease symptoms](/list/apothecary) every two days instead of one. Note all the diseases you get. A creature bitten by you will be infected by all of them.

## Bask
You gain the benefits of resting 8 hours if you rest 1 hour in a hot space. A hot space is warmer than a warm space.

## Tail Sweep
You make a Strength check to trip or shove all creatures adjacent to you at the same time and inflict 1D6 damage to them.

## Lizard Brute
You can use your _Tail_ or _Sickening Bite_ ability in addition to another attack on your turn.
