# Fish School

|  <span style="display: inline-block; width:250px"></span>  |  |
| -------- | --------|
| **Hit Points** 7 | **Armor:** 0  |
| **Hit it:** hard | **Dodge it:** normal |
| **Movement:** swim fast    |  **Size:** medium swarm | 

It **can** breathe underwater and see in the dark.
It **can't** breathe outside of water.

In a swarm, creatures **resist** single target attacks. **However**, they take double damage from area of effect attacks. If a creature attacks the fish school and misses, it is [dazed](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) for a round.

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Tame It</summary>
If you have captured this beast, you can spend the equivalent of 2 bags of gold in food between two adventures to tame it. It is now one of your <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="You can bring a follower in your adventures if you dedicate a Psyche slot to it."><i>followers</i></span>. Each extra bag of gold spent training the beast teaches it a one-word order. Otherwise, it only acts to eat or in self-defence. 
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary style="font-weight: bold;">Hunt It</summary>
Four fish are enough food for 1 day. A fish school produces 1D4 rations. A giant fish produces 20 rations. Giant fishes sometimes have things in their belly: roll 4 times on the following list to see what you find.
 
1. Half digested fish.
2. Half digested giant frog.
3. Half digested human limb.
4. A fisherman, gasping for air.
5. A big fishing hook.
6. A golden jewel worth a purse of gold coins.
  
If you have access to an artisan and a workshop, you can spend loot between two adventures to create something with parts of the beast. The object you craft can be anything mostly made of the provided materials. It will have the value of what you [invest in it](/2024/06/26/currency/#values). Discuss what you want with the referee.
