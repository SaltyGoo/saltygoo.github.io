R: 30'  D: [dice] * 10 minutes

You animate up to [sum] target dead bodies to dance and parade with you. You can move slowly with them but cannot do any action that would interrupt the dancing. Up to as many living creatures crossing the morbid parade as there are dancing dead bodies are dragged into the dance and moves along with you. They are alowed a save if their life would be visibly put at risk.
