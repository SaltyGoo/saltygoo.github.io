You query a creature from another dimension. You can ask [dice] questions and they can ask as many. Answers are not guaranteed to be truthful, and entities will usually attempt to further their own interests. If a particular true name is known, it may be intoned during the casting of this spell, and the named creature will answer. Be careful of the information you give.
