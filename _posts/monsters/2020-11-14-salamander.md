title: Salamander
---

Fiery lizard people. A fire elemental.

Imagine a salamander standing on its rear legs, seven feet tall. Its wet red and black skin is gloing like magma and its eyes are like black pearls.

**HD:** 2  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** strong & sturdy <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As elemental fire, the salamander *resists all damage* and is *immune to fire*. It *recovers 2 HP* every round spent ablaze or with fuel and *loses 2 HP* each round spent without fuel. Contact with it inflicts 1 fire damage. It has the same properties as fire.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Skewer</ins>. The salamander makes a melee attack with reach (1D6 +1 fire damage).

<ins>Scalding Tongue</ins>. The salamander makes a grappling attack with reach, burning its target (1D4) and dragging it to itself.

<summary>Conjuring the Elemental</summary>

If you know the spell [Conjure](https://saltygoo.github.io/2020/11/12/conjure/), you can alter it in such way for a minimum of 2 Spell Dices:

**Conjure Salamander** <br>
R: 30'â€ƒ

The spell is identical to the normal conjure spell, except that you can add treasures as offerings to the Shah to improve the spell. Each treasure either adds 2 salamanders or increase the duration by 24 hours. If you bring the salamander to their death (in an suicidal fight for example), the Shah will be offended and never trade with you again.
