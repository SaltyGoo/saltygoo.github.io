title: Ghoul, Beast
---

A template to turn other monsters into ghouls. An undead.

There is something off with this creature: it is sickly, crusted with dirt, and a long, thick tongue that stretches all the way to the ground. Its eyes are bloodshot and evil and its long, dirty claws are blood soaked. It stinks.

**Add these abilities to the creature's**

As undead creatures, ghoul beasts do not starve to death (even if they do feel hunger), breathe, sleep or tire and can't be poisoned. They can also climb things as fast as they can run.

**Add these attacks to the creature's** <br>
_These dice are for a medium-sized creature. Scale the dice up or down for each size difference._

<ins>Diseased Claw</ins>.  The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D4). On a hit, the target must save against diseases or be paralyzed. A paralyzed target can save again at the end of each of its turns, getting free after two successes, or after 10 minutes if it fails two times, whichever comes first. If the target fails, it catches ghoul rabies.

<ins>Feral Bite</ins>. The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D6). Other creatures have advantage on their melee attacks against it until its next turn.

<ins>Rush.</ins> The ghoul attempts to shove a target. On its next turn, it will act first.

<span class="alchemy">
**Ghoul Rabies**. Disease. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: requires to eat 1 extra ration per day. While sick, you can only eat meat. If you die sick, you become a ghoul.

<summary>Create the Undead</summary>

If you know the spell [Lichcraft](/2020/11/13/lichcraft/), you can alter it in such a way for a minimum of 1 Spell Dice:

**Animate Ghoul** <br>
R: 30’  D: [dice] hours

You animate up to [dice] bodies infected with ghoul rabies into ghoul beasts. Instead of animating more bodies, you can cast this spell on [dice] HD of ghouls to take control of them for the duration. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the effect becomes permanent and the undeads become followers.
