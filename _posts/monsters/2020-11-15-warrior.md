<span class="alchemy"> *These are NPC class templates. Add them to some [humanoids](https://saltygoo.github.io/list/monsters-humanoid) or other monsters to diversify an encounter. Underlined abilities are added to the attack options of the original creature. If necessary, you can adjust the damage to match the base monsterâ€™s.* </span>

Warriors are fighters that operate outside of the rigid structures of armies. Whether they are caste-members of tribes or street-trained brutes, they are characterised in a singular power to become impossible to ignore on the battlefield.
