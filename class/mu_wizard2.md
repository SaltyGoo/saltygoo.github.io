<summary>Design Notes</summary> 
*Inspired from A Blasted, Cratered Land's [cleric](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-cleric.html) by Velexiraptor which I love. I had been using it it my games for a year, sadly my players have a very very low tolerance for complexity and the 3 clerics characters that were played never ended up using the commands feature and I never ended up tracking the disfavors. After months of beating myself for not being a good DM, I had an epiphany inspired by a recent job editing an instruction manual: each domain is a template. Now the class starts simple and gets progressively more complex and hopefully will be easier to assimilate for the players!*

<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
A strange hat, ink and quill, a spellbook (see below)

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of "University Graduate", "Alchemist", "Charlatan", "Forbidden Knowledge"

For every Magic User template you have, you gain one extra **Spell Dice** and you **Study**.

## Spells
A Magic User gets one for free at level 1. They’re stored in spellbooks and you spend Spell Dices to cast them.

<ins>Spell Dice (SD)</ins><br>
You get 1 per Magic User template. They are D6s. 

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum]. 

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to *Catastrophe*.

<ins>Catastrophe</ins><br>
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 *Doom Point*. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you don’t quest to avoid your doom.

## Study
You need a Spell book to study. You cannot take a Magic User template if you do not possess a spell book. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again. As knowledge is a neverending quest, you can always spend a Treasure in town to study more.
