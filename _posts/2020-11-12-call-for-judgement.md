R: 60’		D: 1 hour

You name a code of law and summon a celestial spirit of judgement, a spherical amalgation of wings and unblinking eyes. For 1 hour, it will do all it can to enforce the law to the letter, triggering a catastrophe in face of an impossible task. 

It has [dice] HD, resists all damage, and radiates a [dice]*10’ aura that enforces the law to the letter.
