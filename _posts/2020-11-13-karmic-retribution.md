R: 90â€™

A creature that has wronged you suffers some minor petty inconvenience that, among other things, inflicts them 1D4 points of damage.

For each way in which the inconvenience is ironic, you can upgrade the scale of the inconvenience and the damage die size, up to a maximum of [dice] times.
