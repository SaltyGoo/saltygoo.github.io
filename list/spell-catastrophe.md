Every time you roll doubles on you Spell Dices, you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. They will end your wizardly career if you donâ€™t quest to avoid your doom. Choose the following table that makes the most thematic sense:

### Your wicked powers have attracted the attention of the wrong entity! Roll a D10

1. Your powers have **transgressed the limits** set for mortals by the divine Authority. Your forehead is branded with heretical writing, recognizable by the learned as an invocation to be judged. If this writing is intoned by _any_ spellcaster or cleric, a [greater divine agent](/list/monsters-celestial) will be summoned.
2. The **souls of intelligent life-forms** who die from the consequences of your spells are doomed. Every time one dies, their departed soul is fed to a [dretch demon](/monsters/dretch) which is immediately summoned, and confused and ornery from being so disturbed.
3. Anyone that **makes a deal with you** in the future incurs is actually making a deal with a devil duke who now owns your soul. However, they are not so informed. If they do not discharge the debt, any offspring they have will be replaced with a demon changeling marked with your sigil. The devil will indirectly impede them in their action. Inquisitors are on their way.
4. The attention of a **Demon Lord** is attracted, who can now see whatever you see, and speak using your mouth, though the voice becomes different and ominous. Your eyes now glow a faint orange in darkness. Chaos will be sowed.
5. One randomly determined person near the casting of the spell is permanently marked with a demonic sigil. This sigil conjures a [lesser horror](/list/monsters-aberration) each time the **afflicted person sleeps**. Determine demon reaction as normal.
6. You and all allies nearby **grow long, curving, goatlike horns**. These are permanent, and mark those so affected as traffickers in diabolic magic. Inquisitors are on their way
7. You are permanently imbued with the **nature of demons**, and becomes subject to many demonic weaknesses. For example, holy water becomes damaging, circles of protection keep you out, and so forth. Further,You lose the ability to cross running water without collapsing into unconsciousness. Crossing a line of salt, such as used with some magic circles, causes the you 1D6 damage.
8.
