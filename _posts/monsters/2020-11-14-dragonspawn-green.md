title: Dragonspawn, Green
---

The horrible result of splicing dragon genes into a humanoid. A large humanoid.

_Imagine a humanoid spliced with green dragon genes. A hulk of muscles and green scales, with bony wings sprouting from its uneven arms. Oh, and with sharp long teeth._

_It lives in constant anguish of its unnatural state, hunting humanoids to feel better._

_Strong, surprisingly agile, but its mind is clouded by pain_

| **HD:** 4 | **Armor:** as leather  |
| **Hit it:** normal    | **Dodge it:** hard  |
| **Move:** fast     |   | 

It is **immune** to poison.
It **can** smell very well and hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Charge.</ins> If it has the space for it, the greenspawn bullrushes a target. If it fails to dodge, it takes damage (1D10), is pushed back and is [knocked](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) prone.

<ins>Rake.</ins> The greenspawn makes two melee attacks (1D6) with its blade-like wings and then jumps back nearby.

<ins>Throw.</ins> The greenspawn attempts to [grapple](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) a creature and bite it. On a success, it inflicts slashing and poison (1D8) damage. The target is then thrown nearby, taking damage (1D6) on impact and falling [prone](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions).

<ins>Poison Cloud (recharge 2/6).</ins> The greenspawn exhales poison gas around it, obscuring the area. Each creature near it or ending their turn there must save or take poison damage (2D6) and be [poisoned](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) until the end of their next turn. The cloud has a 1/4 chance of dissipating each turn.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The dragonspawns are a monsters that appear in the DnD 3e module the [Red Hand of Doom](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/28797/Red-Hand-of-Doom-3e). A rare appearance of mutants in modern DnD, but of course they are dragon themed. I made the green ones like sewer monster boss fight. â€” SaltyGoo
