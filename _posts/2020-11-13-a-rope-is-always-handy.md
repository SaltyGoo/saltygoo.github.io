title: A Rope Is Always Handy
---
**R**: Touch		**D**: [dice] x 10 minutes

You tie a rope around your waist and make it act as a third, mind-controlled yet semi-sentient, fully capable hand. The rope can wield a light weapon and make an extra attack in combat.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), the effect becomes permanent.
